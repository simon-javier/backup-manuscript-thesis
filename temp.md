## ðŸ“š **Theoretical Framework Outline (as Questions)**

---

### 1. **What is the central problem, and what existing knowledge suggests a link between fingernails and systemic diseases?**

* Are fingernail abnormalities used in medical diagnosis?
* What medical theories or studies support the idea that nail features reflect internal diseases?
* Which systemic diseases show external signs through nails?
* What are the theoretical limits of using physical appearance for internal diagnosis?

---

### 2. **What theoretical models explain how visual features (like those in nail images) can be used for diagnosis?**

* How does deep learning (especially CNNs) learn meaningful features from images?
* What theory explains how these visual features can correspond to clinical patterns?
* Are there any studies where CNNs were used successfully in other visual-based diagnostics (e.g., skin cancer, diabetic retinopathy)?
* What makes CNNs suitable for this task over manual feature extraction?

---

### 3. **How does probabilistic reasoning fit into decision-making for medical AI?**

* What is Bayesian inference or probabilistic modeling?
* Why is it used in medical decision-making?
* How can uncertainty be modeled in diagnosing diseases from images?
* What prior models exist that combine probabilistic methods with AI for diagnostics?

---

### 4. **How does data variability affect model performance, and how do data augmentation or preprocessing help?**

* What does theory say about generalization and overfitting in machine learning?
* How does data augmentation improve robustness?
* Why are preprocessing steps like normalization and segmentation important?
* How does theory justify these methods in small or imbalanced datasets?

---

### 5. **What is the theoretical gap your study fills?**

* What limitations or gaps exist in previous work?
* Have nail images been underexplored as diagnostic tools in deep learning?
* Is probabilistic reasoning rarely integrated with CNN-based visual models in this domain?
* What will your study do that theory suggests *should* work, but hasnâ€™t been tested much?

---

### 6. **What testable predictions (hypotheses) can be made from these theories?**

* Will segmentation or augmentation improve performance metrics?
* Will using Bayesian inference provide better decision confidence?
* Will CNN-based models classify systemic diseases from nails with high accuracy?
* Do certain diseases have stronger visual markers than others?

## âœ… Bonus: Keep these three categories in mind while answering

| Section                          | What to focus on                                                                                            |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Theoretical Justification**    | Explain why your idea should work, based on theories (diagnostic theory, deep learning, Bayesian reasoning) |
| **Constructs and Relationships** | Define what youâ€™re measuring, why they relate, and how                                                      |
| **Gaps + Hypotheses**            | What previous studies missed and what you expect to happen based on theory                                  |
