It is possible to diagnose human nails and predict the disease. Predicting the disease at the early stage helps in preventing the disease. In this proposed work, the image of the nail is taken from a microscopic image. The lunula and nail plate are segmented effectively using the image pre-processing techniques. Histograms of oriented gradients and local binary patterns are used to capture the characteristic value. Once after pre-processing various features of the nails are extracted using various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines, Multiclass Support Vector Machine, Convolution Neural Network along with an Optimization algorithm named Ant Colony Optimization to improve the efficiency of classification.},

	abstract = {Major underlying health issues can be indicated by even minor nail infections. Subungual Melanoma is one of the most severe kinds since it is identified at a much later stage than other conditions. The purpose of this research is to offer novel deep-learning algorithms that target the autonomous categorization of six forms of nail disorders by employing images: Blue Finger, Clubbing, Pitting, Onychogryphosis, Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, and Normal Nail or Healthy Nail Appearance. Based on this, we build an initial baseline CNN model, which is then further advanced by the introduction of the Hybrid Capsule CNN model by the reduction of space hierarchy deficiencies of the classic CNN model. All these models were trained and tested using the Nail Disease Detection dataset with intensive uses of techniques of data augmentation. The Hybrid Capsule CNN model, thus, provided superior classification accuracy compared to the others; the training accuracy was 99.40\%, while the validation accuracy was 99.25\%, whereas the hybrid model outperformed the Base CNN model with astounding precision, recall of 97.35\% and 96.79\%. The hybrid model additionally leverages the capsule network and dynamic routing, offering improved robustness against transformations as well as improving spatial properties. The current study consequently provides a very viable, economical, and accessible diagnostic tool, especially for places with a paucity of medical services. The proposed methodology provides tremendous capacity for early diagnosis and better outcomes for the patient in a healthcare scenario. Clinical trial number Not applicable.},

Non-invasive methods, such as image analysis using artiﬁcial vision, oﬀer accessible alternatives for diagnosis. This study proposes a DenseNet169-based model to detect anemia from nail images and compares its performance with that of the Rad-67 hemoglobin meter.
Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted with 909 nail images collected from university students aged 18–25 years at the Universidad Nacional de San Martín, Peru. Samsung Galaxy A73 5G was used to capture images under controlled conditions, and clinical data were complemented with hemoglobin readings from the Rad-67 device. The images were pre-processed using segmentation and data augmentation techniques to standardize the dataset. Three models (DenseNet169, InceptionV3, and Xception) were trained and evaluated using metrics, such as accuracy, recall, and AUC.
Results: DenseNet169169 demonstrated the best performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.6983, recall of 0.6477, F1-Score of 0.6525, and AUC of 0.7409. Despite the presence of false-negatives, the results showed a positive correlation with Rad-67 readings.
Conclusion: The DenseNet169-based model proved to be a promising tool for non-invasive detection of iron deﬁciency anemia, with potential for application in clinical and educational settings. Future improvements in preprocessing and dataset diversiﬁcation could enhance performance and applicability.},

It has been a challenge to detect diseases in the human body at an early stage through fingernail images. Various diseases including kidney disorders, melanoma, anaemia, liver disease, heart disease, and many other diseases, can be diagnosed through the images of fingernails. Early diagnosis of mild cases of a disease can help patients guide additional medical care to stop the progression of the disease. Recently, there has been a substantial amount of interest in applying deep learning to diagnose diseases through fingernail images. There are currently a few algorithms that include Densenet201, InceptionV3, Visual Transform, CNN, KNN, etc. that are used to diagnose diseases through human fingernail images. The limitations of these approaches were limited accuracy in diagnosing the disease through images of the fingernails. In this paper, a hybrid model is built using Random Forest classifier that uses the features extracted from VGG16. The dataset is built manually using 1343 images for the early diagnosis of diseases like kidney disorder, melanoma, and anemia. Moreover, the results obtained from this proposed methodology are compared with previous work done in disease detection through the images of the fingernails, which concluded that the proposed model has better performance than the previous works. The proposed method gives the results the following outcomes in the form of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as 97.02%, 97.02%, 96.84%, and 97.01% respectively.}, number={4}, journal={Evergreen}, author={Sharma, Archana and Phulwani, Harshita and Gupta, Ayushi and Singh, Akshay Pratap}, year={2024}, month=dec, pages={3204–3212}, language={en} }

To confirm dependability in practical contexts, testing with clinical datasets is also advised. A user-friendly interface for wider accessibility is one of the future aims, which will allow for prompt and precise preliminary diagnosis.

	abstract = {Background: 
          Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling systems to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence. In healthcare, AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and expert systems. In the specific domain of onychology, AI presents a promising avenue for diagnosing nail disorders, analyzing intricate patterns, and improving diagnostic accuracy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current applications of AI in onychology, focusing on its role in diagnosing onychomycosis, subungual melanoma, nail psoriasis, nail fold capillaroscopy, and nail involvement in systemic diseases.
          Materials and Methods: 
          A literature review on AI in nail disorders was conducted via PubMed and Google Scholar, yielding relevant studies. AI algorithms, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in interpreting nail images, aiding differential diagnosis as well as enhancing the efficiency of diagnostic processes in a busy clinical setting. In studies evaluating onychomycosis, AI has shown the ability to distinguish between normal nails, fungal infections, and other differentials, including nail psoriasis, with a high accuracy. AI systems have proven effective in identifying subungual melanoma. For nail psoriasis, AI has been used to automate the scoring of disease severity, reducing the time and effort required. AI applications in nail fold capillaroscopy have aided the analysis of diagnosis and prognosis of connective tissue diseases. AI applications have also been extended to recognize nail manifestations of systemic diseases, by analyzing changes in nail morphology and coloration. AI also facilitates the management of nail disorders by offering tools for personalized treatment planning, remote care, treatment monitoring, and patient education.
          Conclusion: 
          Despite these advancements, challenges such as data scarcity, image heterogeneity, interpretability issues, regulatory compliance, and poor workflow integration hinder the seamless adoption of AI in onychology practice. Ongoing research and collaboration between AI developers and nail experts is crucial to realize the full potential of AI in improving patient outcomes in onychology.},

Most studies include SUM in the category of acral melanoma, but understanding the specific features of SUM is critical for improving patient care. In this study, we performed a site-specific comparison of the clinical and molecular features between 54 cases of SUM and 78 cases of nonsubungual acral melanoma. Compared to patients with acral melanoma, patients with SUM were younger at diagnosis, had a higher prevalence of primary melanomas on the hand, and had more frequent reports of previous trauma at the tumor site. SUM was deeper than acral melanoma at diagnosis, which correlated with an increased frequency of metastases. Analysis of common melanoma driver genes revealed KIT and KRAS mutations were predominantly found in SUM, whereas BRAF and NRAS mutations occurred almost exclusively in acral melanoma. We also discovered molecular differences in the cell cycle pathway, where CDK4/CCND1 amplifications were more frequent in SUM and CDKN2A/B loss occurred mostly in acral melanoma, and in the PI3K/mTOR pathway, where RICTOR amplification and TSC1 K587R mutations were exclusively in SUM and PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations were exclusively in acral melanoma. Comparison of hand versus foot tumors revealed more frequent ulceration of SUM foot tumors, which correlated with more distal metastases and poorer overall survival. In summary, we find SUM are both clinically and molecularly distinct from acral melanoma, and our data suggest KIT, CDK4/6, and mTOR inhibitors may be particularly relevant and effective treatments for patients with SUM.}, number={6}, journal={Melanoma Research}, author={Holman, Blair N. and Van Gulick, Robert J. and Amato, Carol M. and MacBeth, Morgan L. and Davies, Kurtis D. and Aisner, Dara L. and Robinson, William A. and Couts, Kasey L.}, year={2020}, month=dec, pages={562}, language={en-US} }

The first two conditions are benign lesions, while subungual melanoma is malignant.[1] Subungual melanoma is a distinct subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma arising from structures within the nail apparatus. It is ordinarily a variant of acral lentiginous melanoma, a malignant melanoma originating on palms and soles. Boyer originally recognized it in 1834. Hutchinson described the features in greater detail in 1886, offering a more accurate view of the condition. He described a specific sign strongly associated with subungual melanoma where the pigment extends beyond the nail and into the adjacent skin (“Hutchinson sign”). This article provides an up-to-date and accurate review of subungual melanoma and its management.[2][3][4]}, booktitle={StatPearls [Internet]}, publisher={StatPearls Publishing}, author={Mole, Rosalind J. and MacKenzie, Duncan N.}, year={2023}, month=apr, language={en} }

The aim of this study is to systematically report all evidence on the association of Beau’s lines with COVID-19 infection or vaccination against COVID-19. Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched up to January 2024 for articles reporting Beau’s lines associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination for COVID-19. PROSPERO ID: CRD42024496830. Results: PubMed search identified 299 records while Scopus search identified 18 records. After screening the bibliography, nine studies including 35 cases were included in our systematic review. The studies were reported from different areas around the world. Included studies documented Beau’s lines following COVID-19 vaccination (two studies) or after COVID-19 infection (seven studies). High variability was recorded in onset and resolution times among included cases, averaging 3 months and 6 months after COVID-19 infection, respectively. In the two studies reporting Beau’s lines after vaccination, onset was at 7 days and 6 weeks and resolution occurred after 8 and 17 weeks, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review reporting the association of Beau’s lines with COVID-19 infection and vaccination. Severe immune response can result in the formation of these nail disorders. Of importance, Beau’s lines represent a potential indicator of prior severe COVID-19 infection or vaccination for COVID-19, as well as a sign of long COVID-19 syndrome.}, number={33}, journal={Pathogens}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Agouridis, Aris P. and Mastori-Kourmpani, Christina and Antoniou, Polyna and Konstantinou, Paschalis and Rizos, Evangelos C. and Tsioutis, Constantinos}, year={2024}, month=mar, pages={265}, language={en} }

Digital clubbing, characterized by the bulbous enlargement of the fingertips, serves as an early indicator of these diseases. This study aims to develop an automated system for detecting digital clubbing using deep-learning models for real-time monitoring and early intervention. Methods: The proposed system utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and U-Net for image segmentation, integrated with the ESP32-CAM development board to capture and analyze finger images. The severity of digital clubbing is determined using a custom algorithm based on the Lovibond angle theory, categorizing the condition into normal, mild, moderate, and severe. The system was evaluated using 1768 images and achieved cloud-based and real-time processing capabilities. Results: The system demonstrated high accuracy (98.34%) in real-time detection with precision (98.22%), sensitivity (99.48%), and specificity (98.22%). Cloud-based processing achieved slightly lower but robust results, with an accuracy of 96.38%. The average processing time was 0.15 s per image, showcasing its real-time potential. Conclusions: This automated system provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the early detection of digital clubbing, enabling timely intervention for lung and cardiovascular diseases. Its high accuracy and real-time capabilities make it suitable for both clinical and home-based health monitoring.}, number={1919}, journal={Diagnostics}, publisher={Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute}, author={Hsu, Wen-Shin and Liu, Guan-Tsen and Chen, Su-Juan and Wei, Si-Yu and Wang, Wei-Hsun}, year={2024}, month=jan, pages={2234}, language={en} }
