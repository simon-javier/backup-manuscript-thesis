	abstract = {In 2023, official government statistics reported that the Philippines had a poverty rate of 15.5\%, (or roughly 17.54 million Filipinos), significantly lower than the 49.2 percent recorded in 1985 through years of government poverty reduction efforts. From 2018 to 2021, an estimated 2.3 million Filipinos fell into poverty amid the economic recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.
In 2018, the rate of decline of poverty has been slower compared with other East and Southeast Asian countries, such as People's Republic of China (PRC), Thailand, Indonesia, or Vietnam. National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA) deputy director general Rosemarie Edillon attributed this to a generally low and stable inflation, improved incomes and higher employment rates during the period. In 2022, the poverty situation in the Philippines has seen a steady ease. 
Some of the many causes of poverty are bad governance, corruption, a political system dominated by political dynasties, vulnerability to environmental disasters, and the lack of available jobs.},

This paper explores the integration of AI foundation models across various food security applications, leveraging distinct data types, to overcome the limitations of current deep and machine learning methods. Specifically, we investigate their utilization in crop type mapping, cropland mapping, field delineation and crop yield prediction. By capitalizing on multispectral imagery, meteorological data, soil properties, historical records, and high-resolution satellite imagery, AI foundation models offer a versatile approach. The study demonstrates that AI foundation models enhance food security initiatives by providing accurate predictions, improving resource allocation, and supporting informed decision-making. These models serve as a transformative force in addressing global food security limitations, marking a significant leap toward a sustainable and secure food future.},

	abstract = {Students’ learning experiences and perceptions are markedly influenced by the use of digital technology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Exploring students’ perception of blended online learning, amid the adaptations of the higher education sector in the wake of uncertainty, has become more critical than ever. This paper reflects on the experience of learning and teaching the Research Methods and Techniques subject in the postgraduate programme of MA Urban Design at Cardiff University during COVID-19 in the UK. To do so, we designed and carried out an online survey to explore students’ perception of online teaching and learning activities, feedback and assessment, and digital platforms based on their experience during the subject delivery period in the 2020–2021 academic year. One of the significant findings of this paper was that students agreed with the impact of eye contact on their virtual learning experience but as long as this was aligned with their rights to see others, including their peers and instructors, rather than reciprocal rights to be seen. In addition, students felt that facilitating synchronous communication through effective interaction among diverse peers has been quite challenging in small-group online reading seminars. The majority of respondents also reported that attending live online lectures was more helpful than watching pre-recorded lectures. Online formative feedback and synchronous interim reviews also allowed students to reflect on their progress and develop their projects further before their summative assessment. The outcomes of this paper can effectively assist educators who consider delivering programmes, adopting a blended online learning environment design model, in the post COVID-19 era. The findings of this study can also provide guidance for further developments and improvements in using digital technology and blended online learning in urban design education and pedagogy.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence has been categorized as a subfield of computer science wherein machines perform smart learning tasks with the help of data and statical methods. Agriculture is one of the oldest social activities performed by humans. It provides many crucial things like raw materials, food, and employment. Due to the increasing population, it is the need of the hour that the agriculture sector should increase production of resources to match actual demand. Many agronomic factors such as weeds, pests, water condition and availability, and climate conditions impact overall yield. At present, methods used by farmers for management are traditional and insufficient to meet increased demand.  To match future demand, new innovative agriculture methos need to be adopted. Artificial intelligence techniques in smart farm monitoring can enhance the quality and quantity of yield.  This paper surveys different areas in agriculture where artificial intelligence is applicable. Artificial intelligence enables farmers to access farm-related data and analytical methods that will foster better agronomy, reduce waste, and improve efficiencies with minimum environmental impact. Various artificial intelligence techniques that make agriculture smarter than its previous forms are discussed. In this paper, the implementation of various artificial intelligence techniques in smart agriculture is studied. The aim of this study is to present different key applications and associated challenges to open up new future opportunities.},

A search was performed using scientific databases and portals by identifying for analysis and evaluation 92 VRS methodologies, their impact and economic benefits depending on the main parameters of the soil and environment. The results of the review identified that VRS could adapt the appropriate seeding rate for each field zone, which was based on site-specific data layers of soil texture, ECa, pH and yield maps. Then, remotely detected images or other data which identify yield-limiting factors were identified. The site-specific sowing method (with a variable sowing rate for each field area) allows the optimization of crop density to obtain the best agronomic and economic results. Various proximal and remote sensor systems, contact and contactless equipment, mapping and VRS modeling technologies are currently used to determine soil and crop variability. VRS depends on the field characteristics’ sowing equipment capabilities, the planned harvest, soil productivity and machine technology interactions with the environment. When forecasting the effective payback of a VRS over the desired period, the farm size should on average be at least 150 ha. In future studies, to achieve the best solutions and optimal methods, it is important to test, evaluate and put into practice the latest methodologies on farms, to perform complex assessments of changes in sensor, soil, plant and environmental parameters.},

But it can be very difficult for our eyes to find the variations in colour of nails. Our system can overcome the limitation since whole process happens through computer. The input to the system is images of nail. The system takes the nail image of the person and tries to identify if any features are present or not. The colour and patterns of the nails can be used for the identification of disease. Here, first the nail images are trained with various diseases through the CNN model This trained images of nails are used to compare with the input image to identify the disease. If trained nail images matches with the features of the input nail image, then the disease will be identified. To identify the features properly, the nail images undergo different processes. The images are analysed properly and are processed to extract the required features.},

	abstract = {Undetected changes in fingernails consisting of alterations in color, shape, size, or texture can be a reason for unfavorable results for the health of the human. It has been a challenge to detect diseases in the human body at an early stage through fingernail images. Various diseases including kidney disorders, melanoma, anaemia, liver disease, heart disease, and many other diseases, can be diagnosed through the images of fingernails. Early diagnosis of mild cases of a disease can help patients guide additional medical care to stop the progression of the disease. Recently, there has been a substantial amount of interest in applying deep learning to diagnose diseases through fingernail images. There are currently a few algorithms that include Densenet201, {InceptionV}3, Visual Transform, {CNN}, {KNN}, etc. that are used to diagnose diseases through human fingernail images. The limitations of these approaches were limited accuracy in diagnosing the disease through images of the fingernails. In this paper, a hybrid model is built using Random Forest classifier that uses the features extracted from {VGG}16. The dataset is built manually using 1343 images for the early diagnosis of diseases like kidney disorder, melanoma, and anemia. Moreover, the results obtained from this proposed methodology are compared with previous work done in disease detection through the images of the fingernails, which concluded that the proposed model has better performance than the previous works. The proposed method gives the results the following outcomes in the form of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score as 97.02\%, 97.02\%, 96.84\%, and 97.01\% respectively.},

The study used a dataset of 655 nail photos that had been pre-processed to 224x224 pixel resolution and categorized into 17categories. The CNN model performed well in identifying illnesses like “Leukonychia,” achieving an overall accuracy of 83\%; however, it needs to be improved for underrepresented classifications like “Pale Nail.” The study recommends data augmentation, model parameter optimization, and dataset expansion to improve accuracy. To confirm dependability in practical contexts, testing with clinical datasets is also advised. A user-friendly interface for wider accessibility is one of the future aims, which will allow for prompt and precise preliminary diagnosis. This study shows how CNN-based technologies can be used to quickly and easily identify nail disorders, improving access to treatment and preventing disease},

DL regression models were developed to predict BCVA at the concurrent visit and 12 months from baseline using OCT images.

The best classification model to predict BCVA at the concurrent visit had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.92 in study eyes and 0.98 in fellow eyes. The regression model to predict BCVA at month 12 using baseline OCT had R2 = 0.33 (RMSE = 14.16) in study eyes and R2 = 0.75 (RMSE = 11.27) in fellow eyes. The best classification model to predict BCVA at month 12 had AUC = 0.84 in study eyes and AUC = 0.96 in fellow eyes.    DL shows promise in predicting BCVA from OCTs in nAMD. Further research should elucidate the utility of models in clinical settings.    DL models predicting BCVA could be used to enhance understanding of structure–function relationships and develop more efficient clinical trials.},

Longitudinal OCT data from 129 eyes/119 patients with RORA was collected and separated into training and testing groups. RORA was automatically segmented in all scans and additionally manually annotated in the test scans. OCT-based features such as layers thicknesses, mean reflectivity, and a drusen height map served as an input to the deep neural network. Based on the baseline OCT scan or the previous visit OCT, en face RORA predictions were calculated for future patient visits. The performance was quantified over time with the means of Dice scores and square root area errors.    The average Dice score for segmentations at baseline was 0.85. When predicting progression from baseline OCTs, the Dice scores ranged from 0.73 to 0.80 for total RORA area and from 0.46 to 0.72 for RORA growth region. The square root area error ranged from 0.13 mm to 0.33 mm. By providing continuous time output, the model enabled creation of a patient-specific atrophy risk map.    We developed a machine learning method for RORA progression prediction, which provides continuous-time output. It was used to compute atrophy risk maps, which indicate time-to-RORA-conversion, a novel and clinically relevant way of representing disease progression.

	abstract = {We propose a hybrid sequential prediction model called “Deep Sequence”, integrating radiomics-engineered imaging features, demographic, and visual factors, with a recursive neural network (RNN) model in the same platform to predict the risk of exudation within a future time-frame in non-exudative AMD eyes. The proposed model provides scores associated with risk of exudation in the short term (within 3 months) and long term (within 21 months), handling challenges related to variability of OCT scan characteristics and the size of the training cohort. We used a retrospective clinical trial dataset that includes 671 AMD fellow eyes with 13,954 observations before any signs of exudation for training and validation in a tenfold cross validation setting. Deep Sequence achieved high performance for the prediction of exudation within 3 months (0.96 ± 0.02 AUCROC) and within 21 months (0.97 ± 0.02 AUCROC) on cross-validation. Training the proposed model on this clinical trial dataset and testing it on an external real-world clinical dataset showed high performance for the prediction within 3-months (0.82 AUCROC) but a clear decrease in performance for the prediction within 21-months (0.68 AUCROC). While performance differences at longer time intervals may be derived from dataset differences, we believe that the high performance and generalizability achieved in short-term predictions may have a high clinical impact allowing for optimal patient follow-up, adding the possibility of more frequent, detailed screening and tailored treatments for those patients with imminent risk of exudation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: 
          To develop a deep learning model to generate posttreatment optical coherence tomography (OCT) images of neovascular age-related macular degeneration.
          Methods: 
          Two hundred ninety-eight patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration were included. The conditional generative adversarial network was trained using 15,183 augmented paired OCT B-scan images obtained from 723 scans of 241 patients at baseline and 1 month after 3 loading doses of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. The network was also trained using baseline fluorescein angiography (FA) or indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) images together with baseline OCT images. A test set of 150 images of 50 eyes was used to evaluate its ability to predict the presence of intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid, PED, and subretinal hyperreflective material. Posttreatment OCT images were compared with images generated from baseline OCT with or without FA and indocyanine green angiography images.
          Results: 
          The predicted images inferred from baseline OCT images achieved an acceptable accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value for four lesions (range: 77.0–91.9, 94.1–95.1, and 54.7–96.5\%, respectively). The addition of both FA and indocyanine green angiography images improved the accuracy, specificity, and negative predictive value (range: 80.7–96.3, 97.3–99.0, and 59.0–98.3\%, respectively).
          Conclusion: 
          A conditional generative adversarial network is able to generate posttreatment OCT images from baseline OCT, FA, and indocyanine green angiography images.},

Methods A total of 476 pairs of pretherapeutic and post-therapeutic OCT images of patients with nAMD were included in training set, while 50 pretherapeutic OCT images were included in the tests set retrospectively, and their corresponding post-therapeutic OCT images were used to evaluate the synthetic images. The pix2pixHD method was adopted for image synthesis. Three experiments were performed to evaluate the quality, authenticity and predictive power of the synthetic images by retinal specialists.
Results We found that 92\% of the synthetic OCT images had sufficient quality for further clinical interpretation. Only about 26\%–30\% synthetic post-therapeutic images could be accurately identified as synthetic images. The accuracy to predict macular status of wet or dry was 0.85 (95\% CI 0.74 to 0.95).
Conclusion Our results revealed a great potential of GAN to generate post-therapeutic OCT images with both good quality and high accuracy.},

	abstract = {Deep learning based radiomics have made great progress such as CNN based diagnosis and U-Net based segmentation. However, the prediction of drug effectiveness based on deep learning has fewer studies. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and cystoid macular edema (CME) are the diseases often leading to a sudden onset but progressive decline in central vision. And the curative treatment using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) may not be effective for some patients. Therefore, the prediction of the effectiveness of anti-VEGF for patients is important. With the development of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) coupled with transfer learning, medical image classifications have achieved great success. We used a method based on transfer learning to automatically predict the effectiveness of anti-VEGF by Optical Coherence tomography (OCT) images before giving medication. The method consists of image preprocessing, data augmentation and CNN-based transfer learning, the prediction AUC can be over 0.8. We also made a comparison study of using lesion region images and full OCT images on this task. Experiments shows that using the full OCT images can obtain better performance. Different deep neural networks such as AlexNet, VGG-16, GooLeNet and ResNet-50 were compared, and the modified ResNet-50 is more suitable for predicting the effectiveness of anti-VEGF.Clinical Relevance - This prediction model can give an estimation of whether anti-VEGF is effective for patients with CNV or CME, which can help ophthalmologists make treatment plan.},

	abstract = {Neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) is nowadays successfully treated with anti-VEGF substances, but inter-individual treatment requirements are vastly heterogeneous and currently poorly plannable resulting in suboptimal treatment frequency. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) with its 3D high-resolution imaging serves as a companion diagnostic to anti-VEGF therapy. This creates a need for building predictive models using automated image analysis of OCT scans acquired during the treatment initiation phase. We propose such a model based on deep learning (DL) architecture, comprised of a densely connected neural network (DenseNet) and a recurrent neural network (RNN), trainable end-to-end. The method starts by sampling several 2D-images from an OCT volume to obtain a lower-dimensional OCT representation. At the core of the predictive model, the DenseNet learns useful retinal spatial features while the RNN integrates information from different time points. The introduced model was evaluated on the prediction of anti-VEGF treatment requirements in nAMD patients treated under a pro-re-nata (PRN) regimen. The DL model was trained on 281 patients and evaluated on a hold-out test set of 69 patient. The predictive model achieved a concordance index of 0.7 in regressing the number of received treatments, while in a classification task it obtained an 0.85 (0.81) AUC in detecting the patients with low (high) treatment requirements. The proposed model outperformed previous machine learning strategies that relied on a set of spatio-temporal image features, showing that the proposed DL architecture successfully learned to extract the relevant spatio-temporal patterns directly from raw longitudinal OCT images.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To assess the potential of machine learning to predict low and high treatment demand in real life in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), retinal vein occlusion (RVO), and diabetic macular edema (DME) treated according to a treat-and-extend regimen (TER).
Design
Retrospective cohort study.
Participants
Three hundred seventy-seven eyes (340 patients) with nAMD and 333 eyes (285 patients) with RVO or DME treated with anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agents (VEGF) according to a predefined TER from 2014 through 2018.
Methods
Eyes were grouped by disease into low, moderate, and high treatment demands, defined by the average treatment interval (low, ≥10 weeks; high, ≤5 weeks; moderate, remaining eyes). Two random forest models were trained to predict the probability of the long-term treatment demand of a new patient. Both models use morphological features automatically extracted from the OCT volumes at baseline and after 2 consecutive visits, as well as patient demographic information. Evaluation of the models included a 10-fold cross-validation ensuring that no patient was present in both the training set (nAMD, approximately 339; RVO and DME, approximately 300) and test set (nAMD, approximately 38; RVO and DME, approximately 33).
Main Outcome Measures
Mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of both models; contribution to the prediction and statistical significance of the input features.
Results
Based on the first 3 visits, it was possible to predict low and high treatment demand in nAMD eyes and in RVO and DME eyes with similar accuracy. The distribution of low, high, and moderate demanders was 127, 42, and 208, respectively, for nAMD and 61, 50, and 222, respectively, for RVO and DME. The nAMD-trained models yielded mean AUCs of 0.79 and 0.79 over the 10-fold crossovers for low and high demand, respectively. Models for RVO and DME showed similar results, with a mean AUC of 0.76 and 0.78 for low and high demand, respectively. Even more importantly, this study revealed that it is possible to predict low demand reasonably well at the first visit, before the first injection.
Conclusions
Machine learning classifiers can predict treatment demand and may assist in establishing patient-specific treatment plans in the near future.},

SD-OCT volume scans were segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure.    In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95\% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25–2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31–3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models.    The proposed, fully automated pipeline enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in real-world settings.    Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to inspect the underlying uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty estimates are essential to highlight cases where human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is warranted.},

Random forest classification was used to learn and predict treatment categories and was evaluated with cross-validation.    Of 317 evaluable subjects, 71 patients presented low (≤5), 176 medium, and 70 high (≥16) injection requirements during the PRN maintenance phase from month 3 to month 23. Classification of low and high treatment requirement subgroups demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.7 and 0.77, respectively. The most relevant feature for prediction was subretinal fluid volume in the central 3 mm, with the highest predictive values at month 2.    We proposed and evaluated a machine learning methodology to predict anti-VEGF treatment needs from OCT scans taken during treatment initiation. The results of this pilot study are an important step toward image-guided prediction of treatment intervals in the management of neovascular AMD.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE: To develop and assess a method for predicting the likelihood of converting from early/intermediate to advanced wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging and methods of deep learning.
METHODS: Seventy-one eyes of 71 patients with confirmed early/intermediate AMD with contralateral wet AMD were imaged with OCT three times over 2 years (baseline, year 1, year 2). These eyes were divided into two groups: eyes that had not converted to wet AMD (n = 40) at year 2 and those that had (n = 31). Two deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) were evaluated using 5-fold cross validation on the OCT data at baseline to attempt to predict which eyes would convert to advanced AMD at year 2: (1) VGG16, a popular CNN for image recognition was fine-tuned, and (2) a novel, simplified CNN architecture was trained from scratch. Preprocessing was added in the form of a segmentation-based normalization to reduce variance in the data and improve performance.
RESULTS: Our new architecture, AMDnet, with preprocessing, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.89 at the B-scan level and 0.91 for volumes. Results for VGG16, an established CNN architecture, with preprocessing were 0.82 for B-scans/0.87 for volumes versus 0.66 for B-scans/0.69 for volumes without preprocessing.
CONCLUSIONS: A CNN with layer segmentation-based preprocessing shows strong predictive power for the progression of early/intermediate AMD to advanced AMD. Use of the preprocessing was shown to improve performance regardless of the network architecture.},

	abstract = {Infant motion analysis is a topic with critical importance in early childhood development studies. However, while the applications of human pose estimation have become more and more broad, models trained on large-scale adult pose datasets are barely successful in estimating infant poses due to the significant differences in their body ratio and the versatility of their poses. Moreover, the privacy and security considerations hinder the availability of adequate infant pose data required for training of a robust model from scratch. To address this problem, this paper presents (1) building and publicly releasing a hybrid synthetic and real infant pose (SyRIP) dataset with small yet diverse real infant images as well as generated synthetic infant poses and (2) a multi-stage invariant representation learning strategy that could transfer the knowledge from the adjacent domains of adult poses and synthetic infant images into our fine-tuned domain-adapted infant pose (FiDIP) estimation model. In our ablation study, with identical network structure, models trained on SyRIP dataset show noticeable improvement over the ones trained on the only other public infant pose datasets. Integrated with pose estimation backbone networks with varying complexity, FiDIP performs consistently better than the fine-tuned versions of those models. One of our best infant pose estimation performers on the state-of-the-art DarkPose model shows mean average precision (mAP) of 93.6.},

	abstract = {Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is the unexplained death, usually during sleep, of a baby younger than 1-year-old. Even though researchers have discovered some factors that may put babies at extra risk, SIDS remains unpredictable up until now. One hypothesis is that impaired cardiovascular control may play a role in the underlying mechanism of SIDS. A reduction of heart rate variability (HRV) and progressive decrease in heart rate (HR) have been observed in infants who have later succumbed to SIDS. Many clues indicated the heart could be the final weakness in SIDS. Therefore, continuous monitoring of the dynamic changes within the heart may provide a possible preventive strategy of SIDS. Camera-based photoplethysmography was recently demonstrated as a contactless method to determine HR and HRV. This perspective presents a hypothesis that a camera-based, non-contact, vital-sign monitoring technology, which can indicate abnormal changes or a sudden loss of vital signs in a timely manner, may enable a crucial and low-cost means for the early prevention of SIDS in newborn infants.},

	abstract = {In this study we compare the performance of available generic- and infant-pose estimators for a video-based automated general movement assessment (GMA), and the choice of viewing angle for optimal recordings, i.e., conventional diagonal view used in GMA vs. top-down view. We used 4500 annotated video-frames from 75 recordings of infant spontaneous motor functions from 4 to 26 weeks. To determine which pose estimation method and camera angle yield the best pose estimation accuracy on infants in a GMA related setting, the distance to human annotations and the percentage of correct key-points (PCK) were computed and compared. The results show that the best performing generic model trained on adults, ViTPose, also performs best on infants. We see no improvement from using infant-pose estimators over the generic pose estimators on our infant dataset. However, when retraining a generic model on our data, there is a significant improvement in pose estimation accuracy. The pose estimation accuracy obtained from the top-down view is significantly better than that obtained from the diagonal view, especially for the detection of the hip key-points. The results also indicate limited generalization capabilities of infant-pose estimators to other infant datasets, which hints that one should be careful when choosing infant pose estimators and using them on infant datasets which they were not trained on. While the standard GMA method uses a diagonal view for assessment, pose estimation accuracy significantly improves using a top-down view. This suggests that a top-down view should be included in recording setups for automated GMA research.},

Computer vision and deep learning have become increasingly important due to their ability to process vast amounts of data and provide insights and solutions in a variety of fields.

It monitors the daily activities of the infant such as their sleeping patterns, sounds, and movements. In this paper, deep learning and computer vision libraries were used to develop algorithms to detect whether the infant was in any uncomfortable situation such as sleeping on its back, face being covered and whether the infant was awake. The smart infant monitoring system detects the infant's unsafe resting situation in real time and sent immediate alerts to the caretaker's device. This paper presents the design flow of a smart infant monitoring system consisting of a night vision camera, a Jetson Nano, and a Wi-Fi internet connection. The pose estimation and awake detection algorithms were developed and tested successfully for different infant resting/sleeping situations. The smart infant monitoring system provides significant benefits for safety and an improved understanding of infants' sleep patterns and behavior.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is fundamentally transforming smart buildings by increasing energy efficiency and operational productivity, improving life experience, and providing better healthcare services. Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) is an unexpected and unexplained death of infants under one year old. Previous research reports that sleeping on the back can significantly reduce the risk of SIDS. Existing sensor-based wearable or touchable monitors have serious drawbacks such as inconvenience and false alarm, so they are not attractive in monitoring infant sleeping postures. Several recent studies use a camera, portable electronics, and AI algorithm to monitor the sleep postures of infants. However, there are two major bottlenecks that prevent AI from detecting potential baby sleeping hazards in smart buildings. In order to overcome these bottlenecks, in this work, we create a complete dataset containing 10,240 day and night vision samples, and use post-training weight quantization to solve the huge memory demand problem. Experimental results verify the effectiveness and benefits of our proposed idea. Compared with the state-of-the-art AI algorithms in the literature, the proposed method reduces memory footprint by at least 89\%, while achieving a similar high detection accuracy of about 90\%. Our proposed AI algorithm only requires 6.4 MB of memory space, while other existing AI algorithms for sleep posture detection require 58.2 MB to 275 MB of memory space. This comparison shows that the memory is reduced by at least 9 times without sacrificing the detection accuracy. Therefore, our proposed memory-efficient AI algorithm has great potential to be deployed and to run on edge devices, such as micro-controllers and Raspberry Pi, which have low memory footprint, limited power budget, and constrained computing resources.},

We investigate the interface of innovative machine learning and medical diagnostics in dermatology, where correct diagnosis is crucial. This research aims to test our CNN-LSTM model on various nail situations. We measured our model’s accuracy to evaluate its performance. The model’s accuracy scores in the table demonstrate its ability to categorize nail conditions, revealing its practical utility. The accuracy for each nail state is shown in the table. Staring at the values shows significant model performance differences across situations. With 94\% accuracy, nail fungus is the most accurate ailment. This excellent result shows the model’s Nail Fungus detection skills. Bau’s Lines’ 92\% accuracy rate shows the model’s ability to classify this circumstance. Although Hangnails and Ingrown Toenails have less accurate percentages at 93\% and 91\%, accordingly, the model can still diagnose them. These findings demonstrate the adaptability inherent in our CNN-LSTM approach, which can handle a variety of nail-related problems with diverse properties. Improvements to medical diagnoses through machine learning are not isolated. It affects healthcare image analysis as well as deep learning. CNN and LSTM topologies could transform healthcare, especially skincare, where accurate and fast diagnosis is crucial. Precision requires ongoing research and improvement. To improve model accuracy and robustness, the paper emphasizes class imbalances, model parameter refinement, and dataset expansion. Overall, this study advances the integration of modern machine-learning approaches with dermatological diagnosis. The accuracy values prove the model’s nail condition categorization accuracy. This discovery is a milestone and lays the groundwork for medical image analysis, healthcare diagnostics, and dermatology accuracy.},

	abstract = {Nail disorders can be overt manifestations of many systemic diseases. Early diagnosis is always imperative in such cases. However, existing diagnostic methodologies are generally bounded by availability and subjective interpretation. Advanced deep-learning approaches have been proposed in this research work for the automated detection and classification of nail diseases. In this paper, we employed one of the strong convolutional neural networks, DenseNet121, optimized through transfer learning on a Kaggle dataset comprising 3835 images from six classes. Preprocessing at length was carried out systematically by resizing, normalizing, and enhancing through data augmentation to achieve uniform improvement in generalization. The results reflected an overall accuracy of 89\%, with most classes having high precision and recall. These included the F1 scores and a confusion matrix, underlining its excellence in classifying well-represented categories such as Acral Lentiginous Melanoma and Clubbing, while it was worse for classes such as Onychogryphosis and Blue Finger. This model achieved a peak validation accuracy of 98.9\%, with only minor overfitting, hence showing much promise for real-world application in further improving Dermatological AI with its robust framework for detecting nail diseases. The results point out the potential of deep learning in medical diagnostics while opening up ways toward accessible and scalable health solutions. Future work will increase the dataset, investigate deeper structures, and clinically integrate the model for better clinical diagnosis support.},

	abstract = {Many disorders are identified in the early stages of diagnosis by analyzing the human hand’s nails. The colour of a person’s nails can aid in diagnosing certain medical conditions. The suggested approach, in this situation, leads to illness diagnosis decision-making. Human nail art is used to feed the system. The technology analyses nail photos and extracts disease-specific nail characteristics. The human nail has numerous characteristics, and the suggested system detects illness by changing the colour of the nail. The initial training set data is extracted from an image of a patient’s nails with a certain condition and processed with the Weka tool. Nail To obtain the desired results, the image’s feature results are compared to the training dataset. Deformation of the nail unit is referred to as nail disease. Nail units have their sickness class because of their distinct indications, symptoms, causes, and consequences that may or may not be related to other medical illnesses. Nail problems are still unknown and difficult to diagnose. This study proposes a fresh deep learning system for identifying and categorizing nail disorders from photos. CNN models (CNN) are combined in this framework to extract features. This research was also contrasted with certain other province algorithms (Support vector, ANN, K - nearest neighbors, and RF) evaluated on datasets and showed positive results.},

The aim of this study is to systematically report all evidence on the association of Beau’s lines with COVID-19 infection or vaccination against COVID-19. Methods: PubMed and Scopus databases were searched up to January 2024 for articles reporting Beau’s lines associated with COVID-19 infection or vaccination for COVID-19. PROSPERO ID: CRD42024496830. Results: PubMed search identified 299 records while Scopus search identified 18 records. After screening the bibliography, nine studies including 35 cases were included in our systematic review. The studies were reported from different areas around the world. Included studies documented Beau’s lines following COVID-19 vaccination (two studies) or after COVID-19 infection (seven studies). High variability was recorded in onset and resolution times among included cases, averaging 3 months and 6 months after COVID-19 infection, respectively. In the two studies reporting Beau’s lines after vaccination, onset was at 7 days and 6 weeks and resolution occurred after 8 and 17 weeks, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review reporting the association of Beau’s lines with COVID-19 infection and vaccination. Severe immune response can result in the formation of these nail disorders. Of importance, Beau’s lines represent a potential indicator of prior severe COVID-19 infection or vaccination for COVID-19, as well as a sign of long COVID-19 syndrome.},

The first two conditions are benign lesions, while subungual melanoma is malignant.[1] Subungual melanoma is a distinct subtype of cutaneous malignant melanoma arising from structures within the nail apparatus. It is ordinarily a variant of acral lentiginous melanoma, a malignant melanoma originating on palms and soles. Boyer originally recognized it in 1834. Hutchinson described the features in greater detail in 1886, offering a more accurate view of the condition. He described a specific sign strongly associated with subungual melanoma where the pigment extends beyond the nail and into the adjacent skin ("Hutchinson sign").

Most studies include SUM in the category of acral melanoma, but understanding the specific features of SUM is critical for improving patient care. In this study, we performed a site-specific comparison of the clinical and molecular features between 54 cases of SUM and 78 cases of nonsubungual acral melanoma. Compared to patients with acral melanoma, patients with SUM were younger at diagnosis, had a higher prevalence of primary melanomas on the hand, and had more frequent reports of previous trauma at the tumor site. SUM was deeper than acral melanoma at diagnosis, which correlated with an increased frequency of metastases. Analysis of common melanoma driver genes revealed KIT and KRAS mutations were predominantly found in SUM, whereas BRAF and NRAS mutations occurred almost exclusively in acral melanoma. We also discovered molecular differences in the cell cycle pathway, where CDK4/CCND1 amplifications were more frequent in SUM and CDKN2A/B loss occurred mostly in acral melanoma, and in the PI3K/mTOR pathway, where RICTOR amplification and TSC1 K587R mutations were exclusively in SUM and PTEN loss and AKT1 mutations were exclusively in acral melanoma. Comparison of hand versus foot tumors revealed more frequent ulceration of SUM foot tumors, which correlated with more distal metastases and poorer overall survival. In summary, we find SUM are both clinically and molecularly distinct from acral melanoma, and our data suggest KIT, CDK4/6, and mTOR inhibitors may be particularly relevant and effective treatments for patients with SUM.},

	abstract = {Background: 
          Subungual melanoma typically presents as a darkened longitudinal stripe under the nail plate; however, this disease is frequently misdiagnosed, which leads to a delay in proper diagnosis. Subsequently, subungual melanoma historically has a relatively poor prognosis compared with other cutaneous melanomas, with the 5-year survival rate ranging between 16 and 80 percent. Historically, these lesions were removed using aggressive amputation. To date, the National Cancer Institute does not have guidelines for the treatment of subungual melanoma.
          Methods: 
          The authors conducted a complete review of all cases within the literature involving amputation and/or wide local excision for the treatment of subungual melanoma.
          Results: 
          There is currently a trend toward a more conservative approach in treating subungual melanoma; however, the literature does not offer a high level of evidence, and definitive conclusions cannot be drawn.
          Conclusions: 
          Overall, the studies within the literature involving amputation as the treatment for subungual melanoma could not prove a significant benefit, in terms of prognosis and/or survival, over the more conservative treatment of excision. The collective data imply that melanoma in situ can likely be treated appropriately with wide local excision. The literature lacks randomized, prospective, or comparative studies that would help elucidate whether amputation is superior to a more conservative, digit-sparing approach. Prospective randomized control trials are indicated.},

Electronic databases of Medline, PubMed, and the Cochrane library were searched with the key word “subungual melanoma”. A clinical scoring system is proposed by the authors to stratify patients to undergo biopsy, making earlier diagnosis of this disease possible. The latest trend of treatment involves wide local excision at a more distal level of the affected digit, in contrast to radical amputation of the digit in the past. Studies have shown that this does not decrease the survival nor increase local recurrence, but reduces the functional impairment for the patient. This review aims to summarise the approach to subungual melanoma for clinicians, so that they can recognise and diagnose this disease early and generate the best functional and cosmetic outcome for the patients.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Nail clubbing is defined as distal phalanx thickening resulting in a bulbous appearance of the digit. We aimed to describe non-pulmonary medical conditions associated with nail clubbing using a cross-sectional approach. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the All of Us Research Program, identifying nail clubbing patients by ICD-10-CM and/or SNOMED code. Nail clubbing patients with pulmonary disease (cases) were compared to nail clubbing patients without pulmonary disease (controls). Fisher’s exact test/Pearson’s χ2 test analyzed categorical variables. Independent two-sample t tests analyzed continuous variables. Odds ratios (ORs) were analyzed with multivariate logistic regression adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics. Results: In total, 85 participants had nail clubbing, of which 63.53\% had a pulmonary disease versus 36.47\% of controls. Overall, across both cases and controls, 22\% of patients had chronic liver disease, 17\% hypothyroidism, 8\% HIV infection, and 5\% Graves’ disease/hyperthyroidism. Male versus female patients with nail clubbing had decreased odds of having concurrent respiratory disease diagnosis (OR, 0.37; 95\% CI, 0.14–0.92, p = 0.03). Conclusion: Greater than one-third of patients had nail clubbing associated with a non-pulmonary systemic disease, and a significant proportion were male. Consideration of a broad differential of pathologies associated with nail clubbing is needed to initiate workup and make appropriate screening referrals.},

The morphological classifies the nail according to the distribution of the white lines: total, partial, transversal, and longitudinal leukonychia. Mees’ and Muehrcke’s lines are examples of transversal leukonychia, while Terry’s and Lindsay’s nails are examples of total and partial leukonychia. The anatomical classifies according to the structure responsible for the white color: the nail plate in true leukonychia, the nail bed in apparent leukonychia, and the surface only in pseudoleukonychia. In this review, both morphological and anatomical features have been combined in an algorithm that enables clinicians to approach leukonychia efficiently and effectively.},

Without timely treatment, nail diseases can continue to worsen and significantly impair performance of daily activities and reduce quality of life. Examination of the nails is essential at every medical visit, and may uncover important findings. Brittle nail syndrome, onychomycosis, paronychia, nail psoriasis, longitudinal melanonychia, Beau’s lines, onychomadesis and retronychia are common nail disorders seen in clinical practice. These conditions stem from infectious, inflammatory, neoplastic and traumatic aetiologies. Though each nail condition presents with its own distinct characteristics, the clinical findings may overlap between different conditions, resulting in misdiagnosis and treatment delays. Patients can present with nail plate changes (e.g. hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, pitting), discolouration, pain and inflammation. The diagnostic work-up of nail disease should include a detailed history and clinical examination of all 20 nail units. Dermoscopy, diagnostic imaging and histopathologic and mycological analyses may be necessary for diagnosis. Nail findings concerning for malignancy should be promptly referred to a dermatologist for evaluation and biopsy. Nail disease management requires a targeted treatment approach. Treatments include topical and/or systemic medications, discontinuation of offending drugs or surgical intervention, depending on the condition. Patient education on proper nail care and techniques to minimize further damage to the affected nails is also important. This article serves to enhance familiarity of the most common nail disorders seen in clinical practice. It will highlight the key clinical manifestations, systematic approaches to diagnosis and treatment options for each nail condition to improve diagnosis and management of nail diseases, as well as patient outcomes.Key messagesNail disease is not only a cosmetic issue, as nail changes can indicate the presence of a serious underlying systemic disease, infection or malignancy.Nail pain and changes associated with NP are physically and emotionally distressing and may contribute to functional impairment and diminished quality of life.LM is a hallmark sign of subungual melanoma and this finding warrants further investigation to rule out malignancy.},

	abstract = {Purpose of review
Endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), the current gold standard for cardiac allograft monitoring is invasive, may have a low sensitivity and is associated with significant variability in histopathologic interpretation. Fortunately, on-going research is identifying non-invasive biomarkers that address some of these limitations. This review provides an update on non-invasive blood-based methods for rejection surveillance and diagnosis in heart transplantation.

Recent findings
Recent studies highlight good test performance to detect acute rejection for donor derived cell free DNA (dd-cfDNA) and microRNA (miR). dd-cfDNA is sensitive, non-specific, and has a high negative predictive value for acute cellular and antibody-mediated rejection. Clinical utility trials are being planned to test its role as a rule-out test for acute rejection as compared to the EMB. miRs may have an added advantage as it may phenotype the subtypes of rejection alleviating the need for an EMB or permitting the initiation of targeted therapy while awaiting results of the EMB.

Summary
In this review, we discuss the recent advances in the field of non-invasive biomarkers to detect allograft rejection after heart transplant. We provide a perspective of additional studies needed to prove their clinical utility and bring these biomarkers to clinical use.},

	abstract = {Invasive fungal diseases pose a significant threat to non-neutropenic ICU patients, with Candida and Aspergillus infections being the most common. However, diagnosing these infections in the ICU population remains challenging due to overlapping clinical features, poor sensitivity of blood cultures, and invasive sampling requirements. The classical host criteria for defining invasive fungal disease do not fully apply to ICU patients, leading to missed or delayed diagnoses. Recent advancements have improved our understanding of invasive fungal diseases, leading to revised definitions and diagnostic criteria. However, the diagnostic difficulties in ICU patients remain unresolved, highlighting the need for further research and evidence generation. Invasive candidiasis is the most prevalent form of invasive fungal disease in non-neutropenic ICU patients, presenting as candidemia and deep-seated candidiasis. Diagnosis relies on positive blood cultures or histopathology, while non-culture-based techniques such as beta-D-glucan assay and PCR-based tests show promise. Invasive aspergillosis predominantly manifests as invasive pulmonary aspergillosis in ICU patients, often associated with comorbidities and respiratory deterioration in viral pneumonia. Diagnosis remains challenging due to poor sensitivity of blood cultures and difficulties in performing lung biopsies. Various diagnostic criteria have been proposed, including mycological evidence, clinical/radiological factors and expanded list of host factors. Non-culture-based techniques such as galactomannan assay and PCR-based tests can aid in diagnosis. Antifungal management involves tailored therapy based on guidelines and individual patient factors. The complexity of diagnosing and managing invasive fungal diseases in ICU patients underscore the importance of ongoing research and the need for updated diagnostic criteria and treatment approaches.},

Whilesignificant progress has been made in applying these techniques to major conditions like cancer andretinal disorders, comparatively little attention has been given to diagnostic cues visible in humannails. Nail abnormalities can serve as non-invasive indicators of a wide range of systemic diseases,including diabetes, psoriasis, anemia, and fungal infections. This paper presents a comprehensivereview of existing deep learning approaches for nail disease detection, analyzing key models such asCNNs, transfer learning architectures (VGG16, DenseNet201, MobileNet), and transformer-basednetworks like BEiT. A comparative analysis of methodologies, datasets, evaluation metrics, andclassification performance is provided across multiple studies. In addition, this review identifiescommon research challenges such as lack of public datasets, class imbalance, limited explainability,and absence of real-time implementation. Based on these insights, a generalized system architectureis proposed to consolidate best practices observed in the literature. The paper concludes by outliningfuture directions including mobile-ready AI deployment, improved data diversity, and clinicalvalidation to enable real-world adoption of AI-assisted nail diagnostics.

	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of skin diseases necessitates accurate and efficient diagnostic tools. This research introduces a novel skin disease classification model leveraging advanced deep learning techniques. The proposed architecture combines the MobileNet-V2 backbone, Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) blocks, Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), and a Channel Attention Mechanism. The model was trained on four diverse datasets such as PH2 dataset, Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 dataset, DermNet. dataset, and Skin Cancer ISIC dataset. Data preprocessing techniques, including image resizing, and normalization, played a crucial role in optimizing model performance. In this paper, the MobileNet-V2 backbone is implemented to extract hierarchical features from the preprocessed dermoscopic images. The multi-scale contextual information is fused by the ASPP model for generating a feature map. The attention mechanisms contributed significantly, enhancing the extraction ability of inter-channel relationships and multi-scale contextual information for enhancing the discriminative power of the features. Finally, the output feature map is converted into probability distribution through the softmax function. The proposed model outperformed several baseline models, including traditional machine learning approaches, emphasizing its superiority in skin disease classification with 98.6\% overall accuracy. Its competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods positions it as a valuable tool for assisting dermatologists in early classification. The study also identified limitations and suggested avenues for future research, emphasizing the model’s potential for practical implementation in the field of dermatology.},

The skin images dataset used for this research includes 8222 files selected from the authors’ collection and the ISIC 2019 archive, covering six dermatological conditions. Results: The model achieved 95.4\% validation accuracy in four categories—melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, benign keratosis-like lesions, and melanocytic nevi—using an average of 1600 images per category. Adding two categories with fewer images (about 700 each)—squamous cell carcinoma and actinic keratoses—reduced the validation accuracy to 88.8\%. The model maintained accuracy on new clinical test images taken under the same conditions as the training dataset. Conclusions: The custom model demonstrated excellent performance on the diverse skin lesions dataset, with significant potential for further enhancements.},

A research goal is to create a fusion-level deep learning model that improves stability and skin disease classification performance. Methods: The model design merges three convolutional neural networks (CNNs): EfficientNet-B0, EfficientNet-B2, and ResNet50, which operate independently under distinct branches. The neural network model uses its capability to extract detailed features from multiple strong architectures to reach accurate results along with tight classification precision. A fusion mechanism completes its operation by transmitting extracted features to dense and dropout layers for generalization and reduced dimensionality. Analyses for this research utilized the 27,153-image Kaggle Skin Diseases Image Dataset, which distributed testing materials into training (80\%), validation (10\%), and testing (10\%) portions for ten skin disorder classes. Results: Evaluation of the proposed model revealed 99.14\% accuracy together with excellent precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Conclusions: The proposed deep learning approach demonstrates strong potential as a starting point for dermatological diagnosis automation since it shows promise for clinical use in skin disease classification.},

	abstract = {Background Onychomycosis is a common disease. Emerging noninvasive, real-time techniques such as dermoscopy and deep convolutional neural networks have been proposed for the diagnosis of onychomycosis. However, deep learning application in dermoscopic images has not been reported. Objectives To explore the establishment of deep learning-based diagnostic models for onychomycosis in dermoscopy to improve the diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Methods We evaluated the dermoscopic patterns of onychomycosis diagnosed at Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, Guangzhou, China, from May 2019 to February 2021 and included nail psoriasis and traumatic onychodystrophy as control groups. Based on the dermoscopic images and the characteristic dermoscopic patterns of onychomycosis, we gain the faster region-based convolutional neural networks to distinguish between nail disorder and normal nail, onychomycosis and non-mycological nail disorder (nail psoriasis and traumatic onychodystrophy). The diagnostic performance is compared between deep learning-based diagnosis models and dermatologists. Results All of 1,155 dermoscopic images were collected, including onychomycosis (603 images), nail psoriasis (221 images), traumatic onychodystrophy (104 images) and normal cases (227 images). Statistical analyses revealed subungual keratosis, distal irregular termination, longitudinal striae, jagged edge, and marble-like turbid area, and cone-shaped keratosis were of high specificity ({\textgreater}82\%) for onychomycosis diagnosis. The deep learning-based diagnosis models (ensemble model) showed test accuracy /specificity/ sensitivity /Youden index of (95.7\%/98.8\%/82.1\%/0.809) and (87.5\%/93.0\%/78.5\%/0.715) for nail disorder and onychomycosis. The diagnostic performance for onychomycosis using ensemble model was superior to 54 dermatologists. Conclusions Our study demonstrated that onychomycosis had distinctive dermoscopic patterns, compared with nail psoriasis and traumatic onychodystrophy. The deep learning-based diagnosis models showed a diagnostic accuracy of onychomycosis, superior to dermatologists.},

The Roboflow model was a multi-label classification of 7264 images of 11 nail conditions, and the accuracy of the model was 98.8\%. In the YOLO model using medium and large variations, six particular nail diseases were distinguished with a total of 3,081 images. For the medium YOLO model, if each of the model sizes is trained for 20 epochs, the top-1 accuracy was 78.075\% and the top-5 accuracy of 96.791\%. At the same time, the large-sized model had a top 1 accuracy of 76.471\% and a top 5 accuracy of 96.791\%. Both models were trained based on the augmented datasets which assisted in improving the performance of the models. The Roboflow model was very good for some diseases, such as Acral Lentiginous Melanoma and Terry’s Nails but was not so good for diseases like Lindsay’s Nails, which are not very common. This research is in harmony with the current development in AI in dermatology and can be used to diagnose nail diseases at an early stage and a cheaper cost.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming smart healthcare by enhancing diagnostic precision, automating clinical workflows, and enabling personalized treatment strategies. This review explores the current landscape of AI in healthcare from two key perspectives: capability types (e.g., Narrow AI and AGI) and functional architectures (e.g., Limited Memory and Theory of Mind). Based on capabilities, most AI systems today are categorized as Narrow AI, performing specific tasks such as medical image analysis and risk prediction with high accuracy. More advanced forms like General Artificial Intelligence (AGI) and Superintelligent AI remain theoretical but hold transformative potential. From a functional standpoint, Limited Memory AI dominates clinical applications by learning from historical patient data to inform decision-making. Reactive systems are used in rule-based alerts, while Theory of Mind (ToM) and Self-Aware AI remain conceptual stages for future development. This dual perspective provides a comprehensive framework to assess the maturity, impact, and future direction of AI in healthcare. It also highlights the need for ethical design, transparency, and regulation as AI systems grow more complex and autonomous, by incorporating cross-domain AI insights. Moreover, we evaluate the viability of developing AGI in regionally specific legal and regulatory frameworks, using South Korea as a case study to emphasize the limitations imposed by infrastructural preparedness and medical data governance regulations.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer represents a major public health challenge with high mortality rates, often due to late detection. Traditional imaging methods have significant limitations, including high false positive rates, sensitivity issues, and human interpretation errors. This creates an opportunity for artificial intelligence (AI) to solve these problems and transform diagnostic workflows, potentially saving lives. This research was conducted in order to determine whether AI could supplement existing lung cancer diagnostic methods, analyze the economic costs of implementation, and examine if the regulatory, ethical, and environmental concerns of AI could be effectively addressed. A comprehensive literature review was performed, with a focus on peer-reviewed studies from 2021-2025 retrieved from seven major databases. Performance metrics of three AI approaches (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and ensemble methods) were systematically analyzed and compared. All three approaches demonstrate remarkable potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, with performance across various metrics frequently exceeding 95\%. Certain AI models achieved near-perfect sensitivity and specificity rates, potentially addressing critical limitations of traditional imaging techniques. Economic analysis suggests that implementation required significant initial investment (exceeding USD 137,800 for comprehensive solutions). However, long-term economic benefits included earlier detection, reduction in unnecessary procedures, and improved diagnostic efficiency. Although substantial challenges exist regarding algorithmic transparency, clinical risk management, data ethics, and regulatory compliance, AI holds significant promise for transforming lung cancer detection by addressing critical limitations in traditional diagnostic methods. With continued research and thoughtful implementation strategies, AI systems could substantially improve early detection rates, reduce diagnostic errors, and ultimately contribute to better patient outcomes.},

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC’s ranged between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order to provide guidance around key issues in this field.},

Accordingly, it can also result in significant functional impairment and reduced quality of life. Psoriasis involving the nail matrix causes pitting, leukonychia, red lunula and nail dystrophy, while nail bed involvement causes splinter hemorrhages, onycholysis, oil spots (salmon patches), and subungual hyperkeratosis. Common evaluation tools are the Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI), the modified NAPSI, and the f-PGA (Physician's Global Assessment of Fingernail Psoriasis). Treatment options include topical therapy, intralesional injections, and systemic and biologic agents. Treatment should therefore be assessed on an individualized basis according to the number of nails involved, the part of the nail or nails affected, and the presence of concomitant nail and/or joint involvement.
Resumen
La psoriasis ungueal puede afectar al 80\% de los pacientes con psoriasis cutánea y puede ser la única manifestación en el 6\% del total. Además, se correlaciona con una enfermedad psoriásica más grave, con un inicio más precoz y con una mayor probabilidad de desarrollar artritis psoriásica. Todo ello hace que se asocie a un importante deterioro funcional y a una disminución de la calidad de vida. La psoriasis ungueal que afecta la matriz puede causar piqueteado/pitting, leuconiquia, manchas rojas en la lúnula o distrofia de la lámina, mientras que la afectación del lecho causa hemorragias en astilla, onicólisis, manchas de aceite o salmón e hiperqueratosis subungueal. Los métodos de evaluación comunes son las escalas NAPSI, NAPSI modificada o f-PGA. Actualmente, disponemos de tratamientos tópicos, intralesionales, sistémicos y biológicos, por lo que deberá individualizarse según el número de uñas implicadas, la zona ungueal afectada y la presencia de afectación cutánea y/o articular.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveAn estimated 40–50\% of patients with psoriasis (PsO) have psoriatic nail disease, which is associated with and directly contributes to a greater clinical burden and worse quality of life in these patients. In this review, we examine how recent advances in the use of new diagnostic techniques have led to improved understanding of the link between nail and musculoskeletal manifestations of psoriatic disease (PsD; e.g., enthesitis, arthritis) and we review targeted therapies for nail PsO (NP).MethodsWe performed a literature search to identify which systemic therapies approved for the treatment of PsO and/or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) have been evaluated for the treatment of NP, either as a primary or secondary outcome. A total of 1546 articles were identified on February18, 2019, and evaluated for relevance.ResultsWe included findings from 66 articles on systemic therapies for the treatment of NP in PsD. With several scoring systems available for the evaluation of psoriatic nail disease, including varied subtypes and application of the Nail Psoriasis Area Severity Index, there was a high level of methodological heterogeneity across studies.ConclusionNP is an important predictor of enthesitis, which is associated with the early stages of PsA; therefore, it is important for rheumatologists and dermatologists to accurately diagnose and treat NP to prevent nail damage and potentially delay the onset and progression of joint disease. Further research is needed to address the lack of both standardized NP scoring systems and well-defined treatment guidelines to improve management of PsD.},

The aim of this review is to contribute valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on the transformative potential of AI in healthcare, providing a nuanced understanding of its current applications, future possibilities, and associated challenges. The authors conducted a literature search on the current role of AI in disease diagnosis and its possible future applications using PubMed, Google Scholar, and ResearchGate within 10 years. Our investigation revealed that AI, encompassing machine-learning and deep-learning techniques, has become integral to healthcare, facilitating immediate access to evidence-based guidelines, the latest medical literature, and tools for generating differential diagnoses. However, our research also acknowledges the limitations of current AI methodologies in disease diagnosis and explores uncertainties and obstacles associated with the complete integration of AI into clinical practice. This review has highlighted the critical significance of integrating AI into the medical healthcare framework and meticulously examined the evolutionary trajectory of healthcare-oriented AI from its inception, delving into the current state of development and projecting the extent of reliance on AI in the future. The authors have found that central to this study is the exploration of how the strategic integration of AI can accelerate the diagnostic process, heighten diagnostic accuracy, and enhance overall operational efficiency, concurrently relieving the burdens faced by healthcare practitioners.},

This paper reviews the landscape of suggested ethical frameworks with a focus on those which go beyond high-level statements of principles and offer practical tools for application of these principles in the production and deployment of systems. This work provides an assessment of these practical frameworks with the lens of known best practices for impact assessment and audit of technology. We review other historical uses of risk assessments and audits and create a typology that allows us to compare current AI ethics tools to Best Practices found in previous methodologies from technology, environment, privacy, finance and engineering. We analyse current AI ethics tools and their support for diverse stakeholders and components of the AI development and deployment lifecycle as well as the types of tools used to facilitate use. From this, we identify gaps in current AI ethics tools in auditing and risk assessment that should be considered going forward.},

Their human-brain like structure enabled them to learn sophisticated features while passing images through their layers.

Research on            Explainable AI            or            XAI            has gained momentum to provide knowledge and insights into neural networks. This study summarizes the literature to gain more understanding of explainability in CNNs (i.e., Explainable Convolutional Neural Networks). We classify models that made efforts to improve the CNNs interpretation. We present and discuss taxonomies for XAI models that modify CNN architecture, simplify CNN representations, analyze feature relevance, and visualize interpretations. We review various metrics used to evaluate XAI interpretations. In addition, we discuss the applications and tasks of XAI models. This focused and extensive survey develops a perspective on this area by addressing suggestions for overcoming XAI interpretation challenges, like models’ generalization, unifying evaluation criteria, building robust models, and providing interpretations with semantic descriptions. Our taxonomy can be a reference to motivate future research in interpreting neural networks.},

To unify currently available but fragmented approaches toward trustworthy AI, we organize them in a systematic approach that considers the entire lifecycle of AI systems, ranging from data acquisition to model development, to system development and deployment, finally to continuous monitoring and governance. In this framework, we offer concrete action items for practitioners and societal stakeholders (e.g., researchers, engineers, and regulators) to improve AI trustworthiness.

In this paper, we provide an updated review of known pitfalls causing AI bias and discuss strategies for mitigating these biases within the context of AI deployment in the larger healthcare enterprise. We describe these pitfalls by framing them in the larger AI lifecycle from problem definition, data set selection and curation, model training and deployment emphasizing that bias exists across a spectrum and is a sequela of a combination of both human and machine factors.},

However, even imperceptible perturbations applied to the images can make the neural network performance unreliable. To guarantee an accurate performance in safety critical fields, it is necessary to assess the robustness of CNN solutions before launching. Adversarial attack is a machine learning approach to generate perturbations on real samples to detect the vulnerability of CNN. In this paper, we will use an adversarial attack technique to evaluate a CNN at different training states. The model was trained to perform surgical tool classification task, which was applied to recognize surgical tool in Cholecystectomy to further analyze surgical process. The experiments demonstrate the relation between training states and robustness, i.e. the robustness improved at higher training states, especially for some particular classes. In future work, additional training with generated adversarial images may improve the robustness of the model.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning in the context of medical imaging. Medical imaging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and CNN-based models have demonstrated significant improvements in image analysis and classification tasks. Transfer learning, which involves reusing pre-trained CNN models, has also shown promise in addressing challenges related to small datasets and limited computational resources. This paper reviews the advantages of CNN and transfer learning in medical imaging, including improved accuracy, reduced time and resource requirements, and the ability to address class imbalances. It also discusses challenges, such as the need for large and diverse datasets, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. What factors contribute to the success of these networks? How are they fashioned, exactly? What motivated them to build the structures that they did? Finally, the paper presents current and future research directions and opportunities, including the development of specialized architectures and the exploration of new modalities and applications for medical imaging using CNN and transfer learning techniques. Overall, the paper highlights the significant potential of CNN and transfer learning in the field of medical imaging, while also acknowledging the need for continued research and development to overcome existing challenges and limitations.},

Thus, the present study was undertaken to know the nail changes in systemic diseases among patients attending the outpatient and inpatient departments of dermatology, medicine, nephrology, pulmonology, and surgery attached to Karnataka Institute of Medical Sciences (KIMS), Hubballi.                                Methodology:            A hospital-based original study was conducted at KIMS, Hubballi. During January 1, 2021–January 30, 2023, data were collected by personal interview after obtaining informed consent from all eligible participants using a prestructured and pretested pro forma, among a convenient sample of 272 patients selected by the simple random sampling method.                                Results:            Among 272 patients, 57.5\% of the patients were young adults with male predominance (56.0\%) and inpatients (66.0\%) were more compared to outpatients (44\%). Of the 272 patients, respiratory system (RS) (26\%) was most common involved followed by hematology (21.0\%), gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and liver (17\%), cardiovascular system (CVS) and renal (12\%), and clubbing was the most common nail change encountered (35.5\%) followed by longitudinal ridging (33\%) and pallor (31\%) of the nail subsequently. RS was found as the common cause of clubbing followed by CVS and liver and GIT.                                Conclusion:            RS (clubbing) was the most common system involved. Other systems involvement were renal system (half and half nail), liver, and GIT system (Terry’s nail) which are the specific nail changes that can lead us to the diagnosis. Thus, nails can serve as a window for the underlying systemic illness.},

	abstract = {Abstract               This systematic review evaluates the correlation between nail changes and systemic diseases, assessing their diagnostic utility, sensitivity and specificity. The aim is to highlight the role of nail examination as a noninvasive diagnostic tool, enhancing dermatology practice and interdisciplinary care in line with National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and clinical protocols. This practice is particularly relevant in resource-limited settings, where access to advanced diagnostics may be restricted. A systematic review was conducted following the PRISMA guidelines. The PubMed, MEDLINE and Embase databases were searched for studies published between 2010 and 2023 using keywords such as ‘nail changes’, ‘systemic disease’ and ‘diagnostic indicators’. Studies were included that analysed correlations between nail abnormalities (e.g. clubbing, Beau’s lines, splinter haemorrhages, leuconychia, onycholysis) and systemic diseases like cardiovascular, pulmonary, autoimmune or metabolic conditions. Case reports and studies without statistical analysis were excluded. Data extraction focused on nail abnormalities, associated systemic diseases, and diagnostic metrics such as sensitivity and specificity. Thirty-two studies involving 7250 patients were included. Key findings demonstrated significant correlations between nail changes and systemic diseases. (i) Clubbing was associated with pulmonary and cardiovascular conditions, such as bronchiectasis and congenital heart defects, with a specificity of 92\%. (ii) Beau’s lines were linked to systemic stressors like severe infections, chemotherapy and malnutrition, with a sensitivity of 81\%. (iii) Splinter haemorrhages were observed in vasculitis, infective endocarditis and connective tissue disorders, with a sensitivity of 78\%. (iv) Leukonychia was linked to hypoalbuminaemia and liver cirrhosis, with a specificity of 85\%. (v) Onycholysis was indicative of thyroid dysfunction, particularly hyper­thyroidism, with a diagnostic accuracy of 80\%. In 30\% of cases, nail changes preceded other clinical manifestations, offering opportunities for early diagnosis and intervention. While nail findings alone lacked specificity in some cases, combining them with clinical history and investigations enhanced utility. These findings are impactful in resource-limited settings, where noninvasive tools can guide early management without expensive testing. This review underscores the value of nail examination as a noninvasive tool for identifying systemic diseases, often serving as an early indicator of pathology. Nail changes such as clubbing, Beau’s lines and leuconychia provide clinically significant insights, particularly when integrated with broader assessments. Increased awareness, standardized documentation and incorporation into practice can improve diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes, especially in settings with limited access to advanced diagnostics. Nail examination is an underutilized diagnostic tool. It bridges dermatology and systemic medicine, prompting timely referrals and collaborative management. In resource-limited settings, it offers an accessible alternative, reducing reliance on costly tests. Standardized protocols should be integrated into NICE guidelines globally.},

	abstract = {Background:The nail unit is involved in many skin and systemic diseases. Although easy to examine, this part is often not given due importance. For this, a deeper understanding of the various finer details of the nail changes is required. This knowledge can serve as a valuable addition to the clinical evaluation to arrive at an accurate clinical diagnosis.Objectives:The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and spectrum of nail changes in patients with various dermatoses.Material and Methods:This was an observational, cross-sectional study conducted in the outpatient department of a tertiary care hospital. The sample size was calculated as 158. After Institutional Ethics Committee approval, patients were recruited by convenience sampling. Clinical examination and onychoscopy were done with photographic documentation after obtaining informed written consent. Descriptive statistics were applied for outcome variables, in the form of frequency and proportions.Results:A total of 163 patients (84 females and 79 males) were included in the study. The youngest patient was 1 year old, whereas the oldest was 78 years old. Dermatological disease seen in the study were clubbed into four major groups including infective (66 patients), inflammatory (64 patients), genodermatoses (10 patients), and miscellaneous (23 patients) disorders. The nail changes were divided into nail matrix, nail plate, nail bed, and nail fold changes. Onychomycosis was found to be the most common disease.Conclusion:Nail changes can provide valuable clinical insights, aiding clinicians in accurate diagnosis. Nails may provide evidence in support of diseases that may have occurred in the recent past, even though the skin manifestations may have resolved.},

	abstract = {Acral lentiginous melanoma is a rare subtype of melanoma generally associated with poor outcomes, even when diagnosed at an early stage. The tumor genetic profile remains poorly understood, but it is known to have a suppressed immune environment compared to that of non-acral cutaneous melanomas, which limits therapy options. There is significant attention on the development of novel therapeutic approaches, although studies are limited due to disease rarity. For local disease, wide local excision remains the standard of care. Due to frequent under-staging on preoperative biopsy, wider margins and routine sentinel lymph node biopsy may be considered if morbidity would not be increased. For advanced disease, anti-PD1 monotherapy or combination therapy with anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 agents have been used as first-line treatment modalities. Anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination therapies have been shown to be particularly beneficial for patients with BRAF-mutant acral lentiginous melanoma. Other systemic combination regimens and targeted therapy options may be considered, although large studies with consistent results are lacking. Regional and intralesional therapies have shown promise for cutaneous melanomas, but studies generally have not reported results for specific histologic subtypes, especially for acral melanoma. Overall, the unique histologic and genetic characteristics of acral lentiginous melanoma make therapy options significantly more challenging. Furthermore, studies are limited, and data reporting has been inconsistent. However, more prospective studies are emerging, and alternative therapy pathways specific to acral lentiginous melanoma are being investigated. As further evidence is discovered, reliable treatment guidelines may be developed.},

A dataset comprising multiple nail disease categories, including Acral Lentiginous Melanoma, Onychogryphosis, Clubbing, Pitting, Blue Finger, and Healthy Nails, was utilized. The ResNet model extracts meaningful feature representations, which are then structured as a graph to capture inter-class relationships using a Graph Attention Network (GAT).  Cosine similarity is employed to construct the graph edges to improve connectivity between samples, ensuring that nodes with high feature similarity are more likely to be connected. This approach enhances learning by leveraging relationships between visually similar nail disease patterns. Experimental results demonstrate high classification performance, achieving an accuracy of 0.8791 (88\%).

However, early detection of these diseases remains limited due to low accessibility and public awareness. This study aims to develop an end-to-end, web-based early detection system for nail diseases by integrating the YOLOv8 object detection algorithm with the FastAPI framework. A total of 600 annotated nail images obtained from Kaggle were categorized into four classes: healthy nail, psoriasis, black line, and onychomycosis. The model was trained using PyTorch on Google Colab with GPU acceleration and evaluated using precision, recall, and mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5). The model achieved a precision of 93\%, recall of 88\%, and mAP@0.5 of 89\%. Manual testing on 100 images via the deployed web application showed an overall accuracy of 97\%. Class-wise accuracy reached 100\% for healthy nail and psoriasis, 92\% for black line, and 96\% for onychomycosis. These results demonstrate that the system performs reliably across various conditions. The main contribution of this study is the implementation of a real-time, web-integrated nail disease detection system that is accessible to both medical professionals and the general public. Future research may focus on expanding the dataset, optimizing model robustness under varied lighting and background conditions, and conducting clinical validation.},

	abstract = {Onychomycosis is the most common nail fungus disease in clinical practice worldwide, caused by the localization of various fungal agents, including dermatophytes, on the nail. The tests traditionally used for diagnosing onychomycosis are native examination, histopathological examination with periodic acid Schiff (PAS) staining, and nail culture. There is no gold standard method for diagnosing the disease, and the diagnosis process is time-consuming, costly, and quite laborious. Today, new technologies are needed to detect onychomycosis via AI-based ML to reduce the clinician and laboratory-induced error rate and increase diagnostic sensitivity and reliability. The present study aimed to design a decision support system to help the specialist doctor detect toenail fungus with artificial intelligence-based image processing techniques. The toenail images were taken by any camera initially from the individuals referred to the clinic. The image is divided into 12 RGB channels. Three hundred features were removed from each channel as 25 in the time domain. The best features were selected through feature selection algorithms in the next step to increase the performance and reduce the number of features, and models were created by algorithm classification. The average performance values of all proposed models, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, are 89.65, 0.9, and 0.89, respectively. The performance values of the most successful model-created accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity are 97.25, 0.96, and 0.98, respectively. Although the proposed method, according to the findings obtained in the study, has many advantages compared to the literature, it can be used as a decision support system for clinician diagnosis.},

	abstract = {Onychomycosis is a common fungal nail infection that is difficult to diagnose due to its similarity to other nail conditions. Accurate identification is essential for effective treatment. The current gold standard methods include microscopic examination with potassium hydroxide, fungal cultures, and Periodic acid-Schiff biopsy staining. These conventional techniques, however, suffer from high turnover times, variable sensitivity, reliance on human interpretation, and costs. This study examines the potential of integrating AI (artificial intelligence) with visualization tools like dermoscopy and microscopy to improve the accuracy and efficiency of onychomycosis diagnosis. AI algorithms can further improve the interpretation of these images. The review includes 14 studies from PubMed and IEEE databases published between 2010 and 2024, involving clinical and dermoscopic pictures, histopathology slides, and KOH microscopic images. Data extracted include study type, sample size, image assessment model, AI algorithms, test performance, and comparison with clinical diagnostics. Most studies show that AI models achieve an accuracy comparable to or better than clinicians, suggesting a promising role for AI in diagnosing onychomycosis. Nevertheless, the niche nature of the topic indicates a need for further research.},

	abstract = {AbstractNail psoriasis occurs in about every second psoriasis patient. Both, finger and toe nails can be affected and also severely destroyed. Furthermore, nail psoriasis is associated with a more severe course of the disease and the development of psoriatic arthritis. User independent quantification of nail psoriasis, however, is challenging due to the heterogeneous involvement of matrix and nail bed. For this purpose, the nail psoriasis severity index (NAPSI) has been developed. Experts grade pathological changes of each nail of the patient leading to a maximum score of 80 for all nails of the hands. Application in clinical practice, however, is not feasible due to the time-intensive manual grading process especially if more nails are involved. In this work we aimed to automatically quantify the modified NAPSI (mNAPSI) of patients using neuronal networks retrospectively. First, we performed photographs of the hands of patients with psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis. In a second step, we collected and annotated the mNAPSI scores of 1154 nail photos. Followingly, we extracted each nail automatically using an automatic key-point-detection system. The agreement among the three readers with a Cronbach’s alpha of 94\% was very high. With the nail images individually available, we trained a transformer-based neural network (BEiT) to predict the mNAPSI score. The network reached a good performance with an area-under-receiver-operator-curve of 88\% and an area-under precision-recall-curve (PR-AUC) of 63\%. We could compare the results with the human annotations and achieved a very high positive Pearson correlation of 90\% by aggregating the predictions of the network on the test set to the patient-level. Lastly, we provided open access to the whole system enabling the use of the mNAPSI in clinical practice.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveTo improve and validate a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model for the automated scoring of nail psoriasis severity using the modified Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (mNAPSI) with adequate accuracy across all severity classes and without dependency on standardized conditions.MethodsPatients with psoriasis (PsO), psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and non-psoriatic controls including healthy individuals and patients with rheumatoid arthritis were included for training, while validation utilized an independent cohort of psoriatic patients. Nail photographs were pre-processed and segmented and mNAPSI scores were annotated by five expert readers. A CNN based on Bidirectional Encoder representation from Image Transformers (BEiT) architecture and pre-trained on ImageNet-22k was fine-tuned for mNAPSI classification. Model performance was compared with human annotations by using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and other metrics. A reader study was performed to assess inter-rater variability.ResultsIn total, 460 patients providing 4,400 nail photographs were included in the training dataset. The independent validation dataset included 118 further patients who provided 929 nail photographs. The CNN demonstrated high classification performance on the training dataset, achieving mean (SD) AUROC of 86\% ± 7\% across mNAPSI classes. Performance remained robust on the independent validation dataset, with a mean AUROC of 80\% ± 9\%, despite variability in imaging conditions. Compared with human annotation, the CNN achieved a Pearson correlation of 0.94 on a patient-level, which remained consistent in the validation dataset.ConclusionWe developed and validated a CNN that enables the automated, objective scoring of nail psoriasis severity based on mNAPSI with high reliability and without need of image standardization. This approach has potential clinical utility for enabling a standardized time-efficient assessment of nail involvement in the psoriatic disease and possibly as a self-reporting tool.},

Combining clinical examination with mycological testing ensures accurate diagnosis. Conventional diagnostic techniques, including potassium hydroxide testing, fungal culture and histopathology of nail clippings, detect fungal species within nails. New diagnostic tools have been developed recently which either improve detection of onychomycosis clinically, including dermoscopy, reflectance confocal microscopy and artificial intelligence, or mycologically, such as molecular assays. Dermoscopy is cost-effective and non-invasive, allowing clinicians to discern microscopic features of onychomycosis and fungal melanonychia. Reflectance confocal microscopy enables clinicians to observe bright filamentous septate hyphae at near histologic resolution by the bedside. Artificial intelligence may prompt patients to seek further assessment for nails that are suspicious for onychomycosis.

The development and prognosis of such skin diseases are also closely related to the type and composition ratio of microorganisms present. Therefore, through detection of the characteristics and changes in microorganisms, the possibility for diagnosis and prediction of skin diseases can be markedly improved. The abundance of microorganisms and an understanding of the vast amount of biological information associated with these microorganisms has been a formidable task. However, with advances in large-scale sequencing, artificial intelligence (AI)-related machine learning can serve as a means to analyze large-scales of data related to microorganisms along with determinations regarding the type and status of diseases. In this review, we describe some uses of this exciting, new emerging field. In specific, we described the recognition of fungi with convolutional neural networks (CNN), the combined application of microbial genome sequencing and machine learning and applications of AI in the diagnosis of skin diseases as related to the gut-skin axis.},

	abstract = {Clubbing finger is a significant clinical indicator, and its early detection is essential for the diagnosis and treatment of associated diseases. However, traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on the clinician’s subjective assessment, which can be prone to biases and may lack standardized tools. Unlike other diagnostic challenges, the characteristic changes of clubbing finger are subtle and localized, necessitating high-precision feature extraction. Existing models often fail to capture these delicate changes accurately, potentially missing crucial diagnostic features or generating false positives. Furthermore, these models are often not suited for accurate clinical diagnosis in resource-constrained settings. To address these challenges, we propose MSG-YOLO, a lightweight clubbing finger detection model based on YOLOv8n, designed to enhance both detection accuracy and efficiency. The model first employs a multi-scale dilated residual module, which expands the receptive field using dilated convolutions and residual connections, thereby improving the model’s ability to capture features across various scales. Additionally, we introduce a Selective Feature Fusion Pyramid Network (SFFPN) that dynamically selects and enhances critical features, optimizing the flow of information while minimizing redundancy. To further refine the architecture, we reconstruct the YOLOv8 detection head with group normalization and shared-parameter convolutions, significantly reducing the model’s parameter count and increasing computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate that the model maintains high detection accuracy with reduced parameter and computational requirements. Compared to YOLOv8n, MSG-YOLO achieves a 48.74\% reduction in parameter count and a 24.17\% reduction in computational load, while improving the mAP0.5 score by 2.86\%, reaching 93.64\%. This algorithm strikes a balance between accuracy and lightweight design, offering efficient and reliable clubbing finger detection even in resource-constrained environments.},

As a result, many diseases are left undiagnosed and untreated, even if the disease shows many physical symptoms on the skin. With the rise of AI, self-diagnosis and improved disease recognition have become more promising than ever; in spite of that, existing methods suffer from a lack of large-scale patient databases and outdated methods of study, resulting in studies being limited to only a few diseases or modalities. This study incorporates readily available and easily accessible patient information via image and text for skin disease classification on a new dataset of 26 skin disease types that includes both skin disease images (37K) and associated patient narratives. Using this dataset, baselines for various image models were established that outperform existing methods. Initially, the Resnet-50 model was only able to achieve an accuracy of 70\% but, after various optimization techniques, the accuracy was improved to 80\%. In addition, this study proposes a novel fine-tuning strategy for sequence classification Large Language Models (LLMs), Chain of Options, which breaks down a complex reasoning task into intermediate steps at training time instead of inference. With Chain of Options and preliminary disease recommendations from the image model, this method achieves state of the art accuracy 91\% in diagnosing patient skin disease given just an image of the afflicted area as well as a patient description of the symptoms (such as itchiness or dizziness). Through this research, an earlier diagnosis of skin diseases can occur, and clinicians can work with deep learning models to give a more accurate diagnosis, improving quality of life and saving lives.},

Nowadays, high‐resolution digital cameras and dermoscopes enable dermatologists to capture detailed images of nail abnormalities, facilitating early diagnosis and meticulous tracking of disease progression. Onychoscopy is now a routine technique with well‐known criteria for the diagnosis, but recent developments allow us to visualize certain diseases better. Imaging modalities like high‐frequency ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging, optical coherence tomography and confocal microscopy are being increasingly adopted for their superior diagnostic capabilities. These techniques are described in their technology, scanning protocols, normal findings, advantages and limitations. Moreover, the integration of technology in patient education has fostered a more informed patient population, capable of actively participating in their disease monitoring and treatment regimens. Proper training, validation, regulation and ethical considerations are, however, essential when integrating technology into healthcare practices. Imaging technologies that present the potential to add critical anatomical information to clinical diagnoses within reasonable costs and are available worldwide are the ones that will probably be used the most.},

Clinical assessments and comprehensive US and NVC evaluations of the nail-enthesis complex were conducted on 72 subjects (18 PsA, 16 PSO, 19 RA, 19 HC). Unsupervised clustering models and factor analysis were employed to identify patterns and interrelationships between US and NVC parameters. Significant structural differences were detected, emphasizing the discriminatory power of semiquantitative US scores (GS BUNES, Wortsman type). Trends in vascularization aligned with literature, showcasing dysregulated angiogenesis in PsA and PSO. The clustering model effectively distinguished HC from PsA subjects, revealing a potential continuum between PSO and PsA. RA subjects exhibited subsets with features akin to both HC and PsA/PSO, underscoring the complexity of its manifestations. This study provides insights into nail-enthesis complex alterations, highlighting distinctions among PsA, PSO, RA, and HC subjects. The clustering model emphasizes potential overlap between PSO and PsA. Factor analysis elucidates collinearity in US-detected characteristics, while suggesting limited discriminative power of some quantitative parameters. These findings advocate for further exploration in prospective trials, potentially predicting the evolution of undifferentiated early arthritis and arthritis onset in PSO patients.},

	abstract = {The skin, the largest organ of the human body, covers the body surface and serves as a crucial barrier for maintaining internal environmental stability. Various microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses reside on the skin surface, and densely arranged keratinocytes exhibit inhibitory effects on pathogenic microorganisms. The skin is an essential barrier against pathogenic microbial infections, many of which manifest as skin lesions. Therefore, the rapid diagnosis of related skin lesions is of utmost importance for early treatment and intervention of infectious diseases. With the continuous rapid development of artificial intelligence, significant progress has been made in healthcare, transforming healthcare services, disease diagnosis, and management, including a significant impact in the field of dermatology. In this review, we provide a detailed overview of the application of artificial intelligence in skin and sexually transmitted diseases caused by pathogenic microorganisms, including auxiliary diagnosis, treatment decisions, and analysis and prediction of epidemiological characteristics.},

	abstract = {ObjectiveTo compare the real-world clinical efficacy and safety of interleukin (IL)-17A inhibitors (secukinumab [SEC] and ixekizumab [IXE]) versus the IL-23 inhibitor guselkumab (GUS) in patients with nail psoriasis, with a focus on site-specific biologic therapeutic responses (nail matrix vs. nail bed) in a 24-week prospective observational cohort.MethodsThis cohort enrolled 65 adult patients with plaque psoriasis and dermoscopy-confirmed nail involvement, stratified into three treatment groups: SEC (n=25), IXE (n=20), and GUS (n=20). Outcome assessments at baseline and week 24 included: Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) with domain-specific scoring (matrix/bed) by dermoscopic evaluation using a 10× polarized handheld device; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), Body Surface Area (BSA); Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI). Safety was monitored through treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs).Results(1) By week 24, PASI, BSA, DLQI and NAPSI scores had significantly decreased from baseline in all groups (P\&lt;0.001). (2) By week 24: SEC, IXE, and GUS groups saw nail matrix NAPSI score improvements of 65.9\%, 60.5\%, and 51.5\%, with 68\%, 55\%, and 30\% achieving NAPSI 60; Nail bed NAPSI score improvements were 58.8\%, 68.6\%, and 65.8\%, with 28\%, 65\%, and 40\% achieving NAPSI 60; Total NAPSI score improvements were 62.7\%, 64.6\%, and 53.7\%, with 44\%, 70\%, and 30\% achieving NAPSI 60. (3) All patients in the SEC and IXE groups achieved PASI 75, compared to 85\% in the GUS group. SEC showed PASI 90 and PASI 100 response rates of 80\% and 36\%, while IXE of 60\% and 30\%. (4) TEAEs were mild, including: injection site reactions: 15\% (IXE group); eczematous rashes: 8\% (SEC group). No TEAEs were reported in the GUS group, and no serious adverse events occurred in any group.ConclusionIL-17A inhibitors and the IL-23 inhibitor demonstrated significant efficacy in improving both nail and skin lesions in psoriasis. Notably, IL-17A inhibitors exhibited superior overall efficacy compared to IL-23 inhibitor. Specifically, SEC excelled in improving dermoscopic nail matrix changes, whereas IXE was more potent for nail bed pathology. All groups significantly improved patients’ life quality and exhibited good safety profiles.},

Digital clubbing, characterized by the bulbous enlargement of the fingertips, serves as an early indicator of these diseases. This study aims to develop an automated system for detecting digital clubbing using deep-learning models for real-time monitoring and early intervention. Methods: The proposed system utilizes the YOLOv8 model for object detection and U-Net for image segmentation, integrated with the ESP32-CAM development board to capture and analyze finger images. The severity of digital clubbing is determined using a custom algorithm based on the Lovibond angle theory, categorizing the condition into normal, mild, moderate, and severe. The system was evaluated using 1768 images and achieved cloud-based and real-time processing capabilities. Results: The system demonstrated high accuracy (98.34\%) in real-time detection with precision (98.22\%), sensitivity (99.48\%), and specificity (98.22\%). Cloud-based processing achieved slightly lower but robust results, with an accuracy of 96.38\%. The average processing time was 0.15 s per image, showcasing its real-time potential. Conclusions: This automated system provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the early detection of digital clubbing, enabling timely intervention for lung and cardiovascular diseases.

	abstract = {Abstract                      Background:            Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionizing healthcare by enabling systems to perform tasks traditionally requiring human intelligence. In healthcare, AI encompasses various subfields, including machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and expert systems. In the specific domain of onychology, AI presents a promising avenue for diagnosing nail disorders, analyzing intricate patterns, and improving diagnostic accuracy. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current applications of AI in onychology, focusing on its role in diagnosing onychomycosis, subungual melanoma, nail psoriasis, nail fold capillaroscopy, and nail involvement in systemic diseases.                                Materials and Methods:            A literature review on AI in nail disorders was conducted via PubMed and Google Scholar, yielding relevant studies. AI algorithms, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity in interpreting nail images, aiding differential diagnosis as well as enhancing the efficiency of diagnostic processes in a busy clinical setting. In studies evaluating onychomycosis, AI has shown the ability to distinguish between normal nails, fungal infections, and other differentials, including nail psoriasis, with a high accuracy. AI systems have proven effective in identifying subungual melanoma. For nail psoriasis, AI has been used to automate the scoring of disease severity, reducing the time and effort required. AI applications in nail fold capillaroscopy have aided the analysis of diagnosis and prognosis of connective tissue diseases. AI applications have also been extended to recognize nail manifestations of systemic diseases, by analyzing changes in nail morphology and coloration. AI also facilitates the management of nail disorders by offering tools for personalized treatment planning, remote care, treatment monitoring, and patient education.                                Conclusion:            Despite these advancements, challenges such as data scarcity, image heterogeneity, interpretability issues, regulatory compliance, and poor workflow integration hinder the seamless adoption of AI in onychology practice. Ongoing research and collaboration between AI developers and nail experts is crucial to realize the full potential of AI in improving patient outcomes in onychology.},

Specifically related to brain tumors, the resulting images can be analyzed using image detection techniques so that tumor stages can be classified automatically. Detection of brain tumors requires a high level of accuracy because it is related to the effectiveness of medical actions and patient safety. So far, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or its combination with GA has given good results. For this reason, in this study, we used a similar method but with a variant of the VGG-16 architecture. VGG-16 variant adds 16 layers by modifying the dropout layer (using softmax activation) to reduce overfitting and avoid using a lot of hyper-parameters. We also experimented with using augmentation techniques to anticipate data limitations. Experiment using data The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) - The Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) contains MRI images of 130 patients with different ailments, grades, races, and ages with 520 images. The tumor type was Glioma, and the images were divided into grades II, III, and IV, with the composition of 226, 101, and 193 images, respectively. The data is divided by 68\% and 32\% for training and testing purposes. We found that VGG-16 was more effective for brain tumor image classification, with an accuracy of up to 100\%.Â},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is a leading cause of mortality worldwide, and early detection is crucial in improving treatment outcomes and reducing death rates. However, diagnosing medical images, such as Computed Tomography scans (CT scans), is complex and requires a high level of expertise. This study focuses on developing and evaluating the performance of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, specifically the Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG16) architecture, to classify lung cancer CT scan images into three categories: Normal, Benign, and Malignant. The dataset used consists of 1097 CT images from 110 patients, categorized according to these severity levels. The research methodology began with data collection and preparation, followed by training and testing the VGG16 model and comparing its performance with other CNN architectures, including Residual Network with 50 layers (ResNet50), Inception Version 3 (InceptionV3), and Mobile Neural Network Version 2 (MobileNetV2). The experimental results indicate that VGG16 achieved the highest classification performance, with a Test Accuracy of 98.18\%, surpassing the other models. This accuracy highlights VGG16’s strong potential as a supportive diagnostic tool in medical imaging. However, a limitation of this study is the dataset size, which may reduce model accuracy when applied to new data. Future studies should consider increasing the dataset size, using Data Augmentation techniques, fine-tuning model parameters, and employing advanced models such as 3D CNN or Vision Transformers. Additionally, incorporating Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to interpret model decisions would enhance transparency and reliability. This study confirms the potential of CNNs, particularly VGG16, for classifying lung cancer CT images and provides a foundation for further development in medical applications.},

Recent significant deep learning progress for image recognition has raised strong research interest in medical image recognition. First of all, we found the prediction result using the VGG16 model on failed pneumonia X-ray images. Thus, this paper proposes IVGG13 (Improved Visual Geometry Group-13), a modified VGG16 model for classification pneumonia X-rays images. Open-source thoracic X-ray images acquired from the Kaggle platform were employed for pneumonia recognition, but only a few data were obtained, and datasets were unbalanced after classification, either of which can result in extremely poor recognition from trained neural network models. Therefore, we applied augmentation pre-processing to compensate for low data volume and poorly balanced datasets. The original datasets without data augmentation were trained using the proposed and some well-known convolutional neural networks, such as LeNet AlexNet, GoogLeNet and VGG16. In the experimental results, the recognition rates and other evaluation criteria, such as precision, recall and f-measure, were evaluated for each model. This process was repeated for augmented and balanced datasets, with greatly improved metrics such as precision, recall and F1-measure. The proposed IVGG13 model produced superior outcomes with the F1-measure compared with the current best practice convolutional neural networks for medical image recognition, confirming data augmentation effectively improved model accuracy.},

The computer-assisted method for more accurate interpretation of images has been an older issue in the area of medical images, so deep learning could impact a vital role in the diagnosis of X-ray images. In this research work, the authors have proposed a fine-tuned advanced VGG16 transfer learning-based convolutional neural network model to identify pneumonia disease from X-ray images. The publicly available pneumonia X-ray images standard dataset downloaded from the Kaggle repository have been used for experimental analysis. Data augmentation techniques such as flip, rotation, brightness, enhancement had been used for the betterment of classification and validation accuracy, which further minimize the loss and maximize the accuracy and also other performance measures. By properly applying the fine-tuning methods, the authors achieved an accuracy of 93.6\% which is more than some of the recent literature work. Results suggest that the proposed model had provided better accuracy and can be used as a screening test for pneumonia disease detection.},

This retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the clinical profile and disease-related burden of chronic pruritus of unknown origin. A total of 263 patients (female/male: 154/109, median age 55 years) were included. Moderate to severe itch intensities were recorded (median average itch: 5.5/10, n = 200; median worst itch: 7.5/10, n = 199). In most cases pruritus lasted longer than 1 year (77.6\%), occurred daily (68.2\%), occurred in attacks (72.8\%), and was often accompanied by dysaesthesias, such as burning, tingling and stinging. Quality of life was moderately impaired, while 22.2\% and 12.4\% of patients showed pathological anxiety and depression scores. Scratch lesions were associated with higher intensities of itch and greater impairment of quality of life, while women were more burdened by the disease than men. Chronic pruritus of unknown origin may occur at any age and the majority of patients endure severe itch with substantial disease-related burden.},

A deep learning system was developed and its diagnostic accuracy compared with that of human experts. A dataset with annotations for fungal elements was used to train an artificial intelligence (AI) model. In a second dataset (n=199) the diagnostic accuracy of the AI was compared with that of dermatopathologists. The results show a non-inferiority of the deep learning system to that of analogue diagnosis (non-inferiority margin 5\%) with respect to specificity and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The AI achieved an AUC of 0.981. One limitation of this system is the need for a large number of training images. The AI had difficulty recognizing spores and confused serum or aggregated bacteria with fungal elements. Use of this deep learning system in dermatopathology routine might help to diagnose onychomycosis more efficiently.},

In this paper, we present an approach that utilizes deep learning algorithms, specifically CNN to predict, digitize, and analyze medical reports. An approach is proposed that uses OCR technology to digitize the reports, making it easier to analyze and store them in a digital format. This approach has the potential to improve the accuracy, efficiency, and quality of medical diagnosis and treatment, and can address challenges such as doctor prescription digitization, brain tumor classification, kidney stone classification, and skin disease classification.

Some types of nail disease can cause infection, injury, or even the loss of the nail itself. It can reduce a person's aesthetics and beauty. Nail disease is very varied, so it is often difficult for clinicians to diagnose because several types have high similarities. Therefore, an automatic nail disease classification method based on nail photos was proposed in this study. The proposed method was based on the VGG-16 neural network architecture with an Adam optimizer. Nail diseases including Koilonychia, Beaus Lines, Leukonychia have been classified in this study. The model in this study is simulated in Python programming. The simulation results show that the highest classification accuracy is 96\%, achieved with epoch-10.

	abstract = {Accurate segmentation of fingernail images is essential for biomedical applications like dermatological diagnostics and nail disease assessments. This study compares traditional methods (Sobel and Canny edge detectors) with an improved method using adaptive thresholding and morphological closing for fingernail image segmentation. The methodology includes data collection, preprocessing, edge detection, segmentation, and evaluation. A dataset of 500 fingernail images (free of nail polish) was captured using a digital camera. Preprocessing involves grayscale conversion to simplify analysis and Gaussian smoothing to reduce noise while preserving key features. For segmentation, thresholding and K-means clustering isolate the fingernail from the background. Evaluation combines qualitative and quantitative analyses. Qualitative results demonstrate that the improved method consistently outperforms traditional techniques under diverse conditions. Quantitative evaluation, based on accuracy, recall, F1 score, and Intersection over Union (IoU), further supports these findings. The Sobel method achieves 0.80 accuracy, 0.77 recall, 0.87 F1 score, and 0.77 IoU. The Canny method achieves 0.82 accuracy, 0.78 recall, 0.88 F1 score, and 0.78 IoU. In contrast, the improved method achieves 0.97 accuracy, 0.98 recall, 0.99 F1 score, and 0.98 IoU. The results clearly show that the improved method, using adaptive thresholding and morphological closing, provides superior segmentation performance. Additionally, the approach remains computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in medical diagnostics.},

	abstract = {Abstract – Nail denting or crumbling may result from nail psoriasis. A nail condition known as psoriatic onychodystrophy or psoriatic nails. Psoriasis sufferers frequently experience it; reported occurrences range from 10\% to 78\%. Psoriatic nails are more common in the elderly and in people with psoriatic arthritis. By examining the nails on a human hand, numerous illnesses can be found early in the diagnosing process. The nail color of an individual can help in the diagnosis of specific medical disorders. In this case, the recommended method results in the decision-making process for sickness diagnosis. The system is fed by human nail art. The technique recognizes nail features unique to a given condition by analyzing images of nails. The suggested technique makes advantage of the various distinctive characteristics of human nails to detect illness by changing the colour of the nails. The first training set data, which is derived from an image of a patient's nails with a particular ailment, is handled by the Weka tool. To get the desired results, the feature discoveries of the picture are compared to the training dataset. The distortion of the nail unit is known as nail disease. Nail units have their own disease class due to their own indications, symptoms, causes, and consequences, which may or may not be related to other medical disorders. Nail problems are still difficult and ambiguous to identify. A novel machine learning method for recognising and classifying nail problems from photographs is presented in this study. This framework combines CNN models with data mining techniques to extract characteristics. This research was also contrasted with certain other province algorithms (Support vector, ANN, K - nearest neighbors, and RF) evaluated on datasets and showed positive results. The accuracy numbers show how well the model can distinguish nail conditions. This ground-breaking discovery lays the groundwork for precise diagnosis in dermatology, medical image processing, and healthcare diagnostics.},

The analyte of interest in this study is fentanyl, a highly dangerous and abused drug in recent decades. In this proof-of-concept study, ATR–FTIR was combined with machine learning methods, which are effective in detecting and differentiating fentanyl in samples, to explore whether nail samples are distinguishable from individuals who have used fentanyl and those who have not. PLS-DA and SVM-DA prediction models were created for this study and had an overall accuracy rate of 84.8\% and 81.4\%, respectively. Notably, when classification was considered at the donor level—i.e., determining whether the donor of the nail sample was using fentanyl—all donors were correctly classified. These results show that ATR–FTIR spectroscopy in combination with machine learning can effectively differentiate donors who have used fentanyl and those who have not and that human nails are a viable sample matrix for toxicology.},

	abstract = {Fentanyl, a synthetic, illicitly manufactured opioid, has been the cause of a continuous, steep increase of drug overdose cases across recent decades. Fentanyl is extremely potent, lethal, and dangerous. Traces of it can be found in bodies of water across the world, making it a danger for anyone who may encounter it, not just drug manufactures, dealers, or users. Research into detection methods and biological effects of fentanyl are highly important today. Here, we discuss two different projects related to fentanyl. In one project, we explore a novel detection method using human nails as a sample matrix by using ATR-FTIR spectroscopy together with PLS-DA and SVM-DA machine learning techniques to determine if nails containing fentanyl can be distinguished from those without. In another, ongoing project, we attempt to discover the currently unknown inhibition mechanism of two fentanyl analogues on butyrylcholinesterase through enzymatic assay, Lineweaver-Burk charts, and Raman spectroscopy combined with PCA and PLS machine learning techniques. The results of the first project demonstrate that simple visual examination of spectra is not very helpful when attempting to distinguish between control and fentanyl groups. However, both machine learning models performed extremely well when asked to categorize the data into the two groups. Both models performed with high specificity, sensitivity, and overall accuracy at all stages of model creation, optimization, and validation. This excellent performance only degraded slightly when exposed to unseen data, only further proving their robustness. ROC curves for the PLS-DA model indicated an overall accuracy of 98\% for cross validation and an overall accuracy of 94\% for external validation. For the SVM-DA model, the ROC curves indicated 97\% overall accuracy for cross validation and 89\% for external validation. When classification was considered at the donor level—i.e., determining whether the donor of the nail sample was using fentanyl—all donors were correctly classified. The second project discussed here is still ongoing. Firstly, BChE was inhibited with 2 different fentanyl analogues and enzymatic activity was assessed via the Ellman assay method. These results were used to create Lineweaver-Burk charts to determine if a main inhibition mechanism could be observed. Lineweaver-Burk analysis indicated mixed type inhibition for one fentanyl and no inhibition for the other. The Raman spectra of these samples were then collected and processed using PCA and PLS machine learning methods. These results demonstrated that variation between the sample groups could be observed. As this project continues, we aim to compare the fentanyl-inhibited samples with samples inhibited with compounds of known mechanism. We hope to observe similarities between the fentanyl samples and known mechanism samples that agree with the Lineweaver-Burk results to determine the inhibition mechanism of fentanyl.},

A predominant factor hindering widespread adoption pertains to an insufficiency of evidence affirming the reliability of the aforementioned models. Recently, uncertainty quantification methods have been proposed as a potential solution to quantify the reliability of machine learning models and thus increase the interpretability and acceptability of the result. In this review, we offer a comprehensive overview of prevailing methods proposed to quantify uncertainty inherent in machine learning models developed for various medical image tasks. Contrary to earlier reviews that exclusively focused on probabilistic methods, this review also explores non-probabilistic approaches, thereby furnishing a more holistic survey of research pertaining to uncertainty quantification for machine learning models. Analysis of medical images with the summary and discussion on medical applications and the corresponding uncertainty evaluation protocols are presented, which focus on the specific challenges of uncertainty in medical image analysis. We also highlight some potential future research work at the end.

We also cover several theoretical aspects of deep learning algorithms such as approximation capacities of ANNs (including a calculus for ANNs), optimization theory (including Kurdyka-\{{\textbackslash}L\}ojasiewicz inequalities), and generalization errors. In the last part of the book some deep learning approximation methods for PDEs are reviewed including physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and deep Galerkin methods.

GINNs address the twin challenges of removing intrinsic computational bottlenecks in physics-based models and generating large data sets for estimating probability distributions of quantities of interest (QoIs) with a high degree of confidence. Both the selection of the complex physics learned by the NN and its supervised learning/prediction are informed by the PGM, which includes the formulation of structured priors for tunable control variables (CVs) to account for their mutual correlations and ensure physically sound CV and QoI distributions. GINNs accelerate the prediction of QoIs essential for simulation-based decision-making where generating sufficient sample data using physics-based models alone is often prohibitively expensive. Using a real-world application grounded in supercapacitor-based energy storage, we describe the construction of GINNs from a Bayesian network-embedded homogenized model for supercapacitor dynamics, and demonstrate their ability to produce kernel density estimates of relevant non-Gaussian, skewed QoIs with tight confidence intervals.},

	abstract = {Bayesian inference has many advantages in decision making of agents (e.g. robotics/simulative agent) over a regular data-driven black-box neural network: Data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety where these advantages benefit directly/indirectly from the uncertainty quantification of Bayesian inference. However, there are few comprehensive reviews to summarize the progress of Bayesian inference on reinforcement learning ({RL}) for decision making to give researchers a systematic understanding. This paper focuses on combining Bayesian inference with {RL} that nowadays is an important approach in agent decision making. To be exact, this paper discusses the following five topics: 1) Bayesian methods that have potential for agent decision making. First basic Bayesian methods and models (Bayesian rule, Bayesian learning, and Bayesian conjugate models) are discussed followed by variational inference, Bayesian optimization, Bayesian deep learning, Bayesian active learning, Bayesian generative models, Bayesian meta-learning, and lifelong Bayesian learning. 2) Classical combinations of Bayesian methods with model-based {RL} (with approximation methods), model-free {RL}, and inverse {RL}. 3) Latest combinations of potential Bayesian methods with {RL}. 4) Analytical comparisons of methods that combine Bayesian methods with {RL} with respect to data-efficiency, generalization, interpretability, and safety. 5) In-depth discussions in six complex problem variants of {RL}, including unknown reward, partial-observability, multi-agent, multi-task, non-linear non-Gaussian, and hierarchical {RL} problems and the summary of how Bayesian methods work in the data collection, data processing and policy learning stages of {RL} to pave the way for better agent decision-making strategies.},

	abstract = {Bayesian uncertainty quantification is the key element to many machine learning applications. To this end, approximate inference algorithms are developed to perform inference at a relatively low cost. Despite the recent advancements of scaling approximate inference to “big model \${\textbackslash}times\$ big data” regimes, many open challenges remain. For instance, how to properly quantify the parameter uncertainties for complicated, non-identifiable models (such as neural networks)? How to properly handle the uncertainties caused by missing data, and perform learning/inference in a scalable way? Furthermore, how to optimally collect new information, so that missing data uncertainties can be further reduced, and better decisions can be made? In this work, we propose new research directions and new technical contributions towards these research questions. This thesis is organized in two parts (theme A and theme B). In theme A, we consider quantifying model uncertainty under the supervised learning setting. To step aside some of the difficulties of parameter-space inference, we propose a new research direction called function space approximate inference. That is, by treating supervised probabilistic models as stochastic processes (measures over functions), we can now approximate the true posterior of the predictive functions by another class of (simpler) stochastic processes. We provide two different methodologies for function space inference and demonstrate that they return better uncertainty estimates, as well as improved empirical performances on complicated models. In theme B, we consider the quantification of missing data uncertainty under the unsupervised learning setting. We propose a new approach for quantifying missing data uncertainty, based on deep generative models. It allows us to step aside from the computational burden of traditional methods, and perform accurate and scalable missing data imputation. Furthermore, by utilizing the uncertainty estimates returned by the generative models, we propose an information-theoretic framework for efficient, scalable, and personalized active information acquisition. This allows us to maximally reduce missing data uncertainty, and make improved decisions with new information.},

	abstract = {Although deep neural networks have demonstrated significant success due to their powerful expressiveness, most models struggle to meet practical requirements for uncertainty estimation. Concurrently, the entangled nature of deep neural net- works leads to a multifaceted problem, where various localized explanation tech- niques reveal that multiple unrelated features influence the decisions, thereby un- dermining interpretability. To address these challenges, we develop a Bayesian Nonnegative Decision Layer ({BNDL}), which reformulates deep neural networks as a conditional Bayesian non-negative factor analysis. By leveraging stochastic latent variables, the {BNDL} can model complex dependencies and provide robust uncertainty estimation. Moreover, the sparsity and non-negativity of the latent variables encourage the model to learn disentangled representations and decision layers, thereby improving interpretability. We also offer theoretical guarantees that {BNDL} can achieve effective disentangled learning. In addition, we developed a corresponding variational inference method utilizing a Weibull variational in- ference network to approximate the posterior distribution of the latent variables. Our experimental results demonstrate that with enhanced disentanglement capa- bilities, {BNDL} not only improves the model’s accuracy but also provides reliable uncertainty estimation and improved interpretability.},

	abstract = {Modern neural network architectures have achieved remarkable accuracies but remain highly dependent on their training data, often lacking interpretability in their learned mappings. While effective on large datasets, they tend to overfit on smaller ones. Probabilistic neural networks, such as those utilizing variational inference, address this limitation by incorporating uncertainty estimation through weight distributions rather than point estimates. However, standard variational inference often relies on a single-density approximation, which can lead to poor posterior estimates and hinder model performance. We propose Boosted Bayesian Neural Networks ({BBNN}), a novel approach that enhances neural network weight distribution approximations using Boosting Variational Inference ({BVI}). By iteratively constructing a mixture of densities, {BVI} expands the approximating family, enabling a more expressive posterior that leads to improved generalization and uncertainty estimation. While this approach increases computational complexity, it significantly enhances accuracy an essential tradeoff, particularly in high-stakes applications such as medical diagnostics, where false negatives can have severe consequences. Our experimental results demonstrate that {BBNN} achieves {\textasciitilde}5\% higher accuracy compared to conventional neural networks while providing superior uncertainty quantification. This improvement highlights the effectiveness of leveraging a mixture-based variational family to better approximate the posterior distribution, ultimately advancing probabilistic deep learning.},

Using Bayes Theorem and conditional probability densities, we demonstrate how each uncertainty source can be systematically quantified. We also introduce a fast and practical way to incorporate and combine all sources of errors for the first time. For illustration, the new method is applied to quantify errors in cloud autoconversion rates, predicted from an artificial neural network that was trained by aircraft cloud probe measurements in the Azores and the stochastic collection equation formulated as a two-moment bin model. For this specific example, the output uncertainty arising from uncertainty in the training and testing data is dominant, followed by uncertainty in the input data, in the trained neural network, and uncertainty in the weights. We discuss the usefulness of the methodology for machine learning practice, and how, through inclusion of uncertainty in the training data, the new methodology is less sensitive to input data that falls outside of the training data set.},

	abstract = {The Bayesian approach to clustering is often appreciated for its ability to provide uncertainty in the partition structure. However, summarizing the posterior distribution over the clustering structure can be challenging, due the discrete, unordered nature and massive dimension of the space. While recent advancements provide a single clustering estimate to represent the posterior, this ignores uncertainty and may even be unrepresentative in instances where the posterior is multimodal. To enhance our understanding of uncertainty, we propose a {WASserstein} Approximation for Bayesian {clusterIng} ({WASABI}), which summarizes the posterior samples with not one, but multiple clustering estimates, each corresponding to a different part of the space of partitions that receives substantial posterior mass. Specifically, we find such clustering estimates by approximating the posterior distribution in a Wasserstein distance sense, equipped with a suitable metric on the partition space. An interesting byproduct is that a locally optimal solution to this problem can be found using a k-medoids-like algorithm on the partition space to divide the posterior samples into different groups, each represented by one of the clustering estimates. Using both synthetic and real datasets, we show that our proposal helps to improve the understanding of uncertainty, particularly when the data clusters are not well separated or when the employed model is misspecified.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization ({BO}) with Gaussian processes ({GP}) has become an indispensable algorithm for black box optimization problems. Not without a dash of irony, {BO} is often considered a black box itself, lacking ways to provide reasons as to why certain parameters are proposed to be evaluated. This is particularly relevant in human-in-the-loop applications of {BO}, such as in robotics. We address this issue by proposing {ShapleyBO}, a framework for interpreting {BO}'s proposals by game-theoretic Shapley values.They quantify each parameter's contribution to {BO}'s acquisition function. Exploiting the linearity of Shapley values, we are further able to identify how strongly each parameter drives {BO}'s exploration and exploitation for additive acquisition functions like the confidence bound. We also show that {ShapleyBO} can disentangle the contributions to exploration into those that explore aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Moreover, our method gives rise to a {ShapleyBO}-assisted human machine interface ({HMI}), allowing users to interfere with {BO} in case proposals do not align with human reasoning. We demonstrate this {HMI}'s benefits for the use case of personalizing wearable robotic devices (assistive back exosuits) by human-in-the-loop {BO}. Results suggest human-{BO} teams with access to {ShapleyBO} can achieve lower regret than teams without.},

	abstract = {Data valuation has become an increasingly significant discipline in data science due to the economic value of data. In the context of machine learning ({ML}), data valuation methods aim to equitably measure the contribution of each data point to the utility of an {ML} model. One prevalent method is Shapley value, which helps identify data points that are beneficial or detrimental to an {ML} model. However, traditional Shapley-based data valuation methods may not effectively distinguish between beneficial and detrimental training data points for probabilistic classifiers. In this paper, we propose Probabilistic Shapley (P-Shapley) value by constructing a probability-wise utility function that leverages the predicted class probabilities of probabilistic classifiers rather than binarized prediction results in the traditional Shapley value. We also offer several activation functions for confidence calibration to effectively quantify the marginal contribution of each data point to the probabilistic classifiers. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed P-Shapley value in evaluating the importance of data for building a high-usability and trustworthy {ML} model.},

	abstract = {In a multi-channel marketing world, the purchase decision journey encounters many interactions (e.g., email, mobile notifications, display advertising, social media, and so on). These impressions have direct (main effects), as well as interactive influence on the final decision of the customer. To maximize conversions, a marketer needs to understand how each of these marketing efforts individually and collectively affect the customer's final decision. This insight will help her optimize the advertising budget over interacting marketing channels. This problem of interpreting the influence of various marketing channels to the customer's decision process is called marketing attribution. We propose a Bayesian model of marketing attribution that captures established modes of action of advertisements, including the direct effect of the ad, decay of the ad effect, interaction between ads, and customer heterogeneity. Our model allows us to incorporate information from customer's features and provides usable error bounds for parameters of interest, like the ad effect or the half-life of an ad.

	abstract = {Scientific analysis of motion and social interaction can identify animal models of human disease by relating genetics or neural activity to behavior. However, experiments are often limited in scope because they require vast quantities of expert annotation on private data. Attempts to automate aspects of behavior science typically have limited interpretability and lack uncertainty representation. Errors will go unrecognized without manual inspection and propagate to hypothesis tests, corrupting conclusions. In response, this dissertation develops principled Bayesian approaches to low-level behavior analysis that discover the articulated part structure of a moving object and quantify uncertainty in the motion of multiple objects. Uncertainty is used to identify possible errors and automatically schedule sparse annotations. We apply parts modeling and tracking to primate behavior data in experimental and observational settings, in one case contributing to the first evidence supporting the use of primate animal models in autism research. We additionally develop Marmoset100, a 100-hour {RGB}-Depth dataset of pairwise primate social interactions labeled with 25 high-level behaviors, and show that uncertainty representation in tracking estimates improves behavior classification. 

The Nonparametric Parts Model ({NPP}) discovers structure by learning articulated parts decompositions in an unsupervised fashion by briefly observing objects moving in an image, depth, point cloud, or mesh sequences. {NPP} combines distributions on Lie groups with a Bayesian nonparametric prior to perform joint reasoning over an interpretable state-space model with nonlinear dynamics and state-dependent observation noise. In developing sampling-based inference for {NPP}, we discover a novel and efficient Gibbs decomposition for prior distributions on {SE}(D), the manifold of rigid transformations. We show that {NPP} learns intuitive part segmentations for diverse objects and enables both analysis and synthesis of relative part motion in the body frame. 

The Joint Posterior Tracker ({JPT}) is a comprehensive Bayesian treatment of the general multiobject tracking problem that quantities uncertainty in the motion of multiple objects. {JPT} uniquely performs asymptotically exact inference without gating heuristics or the combinatorial costs of exponential and factorial complexity. We develop novel Metropolis-Hastings proposals that reason over permutations of the latent space and enable efficient posterior mode hopping that correspond to possible confusion events. We show that {JPT} yields accurate uncertainty representation of data associations with high performance on standard metrics. Finally, we use posterior uncertainty to identify ambiguities in observed data and automatically schedule sparse human annotations that rapidly improve posterior estimates and reduce uncertainty.},

	abstract = {Oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder, collectively referred to as disruptive behavior disorders ({DBDs}), are prevalent psychiatric disorders in children. Early diagnosis of {DBDs} is crucial because they can increase the risks of other mental health and substance use disorders without appropriate psychosocial interventions and treatment. However, diagnosing {DBDs} is challenging as they are often comorbid with other disorders, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression. In this study, a multimodal ensemble 3D convolutional neural network ({CNN}) deep learning model was used to classify children with {DBDs} and typically developing children. The study participants included 419 girls and 681 boys, aged 108 to 131 months who were enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Children were grouped based on the presence of {DBDs} (n=550) and typically developing (n=550); assessments were based on the scores from the Child Behavior Checklist and on the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-age Children–Present and Lifetime version for {DSM}-5. The diffusion, structural, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-{fMRI}) data were used as input data to the 3D {CNN}. The model achieved 72\% accuracy in classifying children with {DBDs} with 70\% sensitivity and 72\% specificity. In addition, the discriminative power of the classifier was investigated by delineating the cortical and subcortical regions primarily involved in the prediction of {DBDs} using a gradient class activation map. The classification results were compared with those obtained using the three neuroimaging modalities individually, and a connectome-based graph {CNN} and a multi-scale recurrent neural network using only the rs-{fMRI} data.},

	abstract = {In breast cancer research, diverse data types and formats, such as radiological images, clinical records, histological data, and expression analysis, are employed. Given the intricate nature of natural phenomena, relying on the features of a single modality is seldom sufficient for comprehensive analysis. Therefore, it is possible to guarantee medical relevance and achieve improved clinical outcomes by combining several modalities. The presen study carefully maps and reviews 47 primary articles from six well-known digital libraries that were published between 2018 and 2023 for breast cancer classification based on multimodal deep learning fusion ({MDLF}) techniques. This systematic literature review encompasses various aspects, including the medical modalities combined, the datasets utilized in these studies, the techniques, models, and architectures used in {MDLF} and it also discusses the advantages and limitations of each approach. The analysis of selected papers has revealed a compelling trend: the emergence of new modalities and combinations that were previously unexplored in the context of breast cancer classification. This exploration has not only expanded the scope of predictive models but also introduced fresh perspectives for addressing diverse targets, ranging from screening to diagnosis and prognosis. The practical advantages of {MDLF} are evident in its ability to enhance the predictive capabilities of machine learning models, resulting in improved accuracy across diverse applications. The prevalence of deep learning models underscores their success in autonomously discerning complex patterns, offering a substantial departure from traditional machine learning approaches. Furthermore, the paper explores the challenges and future directions in this field, including the need for larger datasets, the use of ensemble learning methods, and the interpretation of multimodal models.},

	abstract = {The implementation of {AI} assisted cancer detection systems in clinical environments has faced numerous hurdles, mainly because of the restricted explainability of their elemental mechanisms, even though such detection systems have proven to be highly effective. Medical practitioners are skeptical about adopting {AI} assisted diagnoses as due to the latter’s inability to be transparent about decision making processes. In this respect, explainable artificial intelligence ({XAI}) has emerged to provide explanations for model predictions, thereby overcoming the computational black box problem associated with {AI} systems. In this particular research, the focal point has been the exploration of the Shapley additive explanations ({SHAP}) and local interpretable model-agnostic explanations ({LIME}) approaches which enable model prediction explanations. This study used an ensemble model consisting of three convolutional neural networks({CNN}): {InceptionV}3, {InceptionResNetV}2 and {VGG}16, which was based on averaging techniques and by combining their respective predictions. These models were trained on the Kvasir dataset, which consists of pathological findings related to gastrointestinal cancer. An accuracy of 96.89\% and F1-scores of 96.877\% were attained by our ensemble model. Following the training of the ensemble model, we employed {SHAP} and {LIME} to analyze images from the three classes, aiming to provide explanations regarding the deterministic features influencing the model’s predictions. The results obtained from this analysis demonstrated a positive and encouraging advancement in the exploration of {XAI} approaches, specifically in the context of gastrointestinal cancer detection within the healthcare domain.},

Its use has historically been focused on single modal data. Attempts to improve prediction and mimic the multimodal nature of clinical expert decision-making has been met in the biomedical field of machine learning by fusing disparate data. This review was conducted to summarize the current studies in this field and identify topics ripe for future research. We conducted this review in accordance with the {PRISMA} extension for Scoping Reviews to characterize multi-modal data fusion in health. Search strings were established and used in databases: {PubMed}, Google Scholar, and {IEEEXplore} from 2011 to 2021. A final set of 128 articles were included in the analysis. The most common health areas utilizing multi-modal methods were neurology and oncology. Early fusion was the most common data merging strategy. Notably, there was an improvement in predictive performance when using data fusion. Lacking from the papers were clear clinical deployment strategies, {FDA}-approval, and analysis of how using multimodal approaches from diverse sub-populations may improve biases and healthcare disparities. These findings provide a summary on multimodal data fusion as applied to health diagnosis/prognosis problems. Few papers compared the outputs of a multimodal approach with a unimodal prediction. However, those that did achieved an average increase of 6.4\% in predictive accuracy. Multi-modal machine learning, while more robust in its estimations over unimodal methods, has drawbacks in its scalability and the time-consuming nature of information concatenation.},

	abstract = {The study explores end-to-end deep learning frameworks and ensemble methods to enhance the accuracy of anatomical landmark identification in cephalometric radiographs, crucial for precise cephalometric analysis and effective orthodontic treatment planning. The methodology is strategically designed to address the complexities and variations in cephalometric images through a dual learning process: building base learners using end-to-end regression approaches and then constructing a meta-learner that ensembles the output of the base models to obtain collective predictions. Two primary approaches are followed to design base learners: an end-to-end single model and a multi-model strategy for localizing landmarks. Additionally, the efficacy of these approaches is examined by implementing two distinct deep architectures, namely {UNet} and {UNetPlusPlus}. The combination of the single model and multi-model approach with {UNet} and {UNetPlusPlus} results in four base learners, each displaying varying accuracy for different landmarks. To leverage the strengths of these individual models, three ensemble methods are explored, that includes supervised ensembling with {XGBoost}, unsupervised ensembling with the {DBSCAN} algorithm, and mathematical aggregation using weighted averaging. The methodology is evaluated on both public and private datasets, comprising 400 and 700 images, respectively. The multi-model approach demonstrates superior performance, achieving the highest detection accuracy of 79.9\% ({UNet}) for the benchmark dataset and 92.8\% ({UNetPlusPlus}) for the private dataset. The ensemble meta-model further boosts accuracy to 83.61\% and 95.4\%, respectively, reducing mean radial errors by 0.38 mm and 0.33 mm. These results highlight significant improvements in accuracy and error reduction through strategic combinations of deep learning architectures and ensemble techniques demonstrating the ability to significantly enhance cephalometric landmark annotation accuracy, which is critical for the practical applicability of the methodology.},

Accurate and efficient classification of brain tumors, including gliomas, meningiomas, and pituitary adenomas, is critical for early diagnosis and treatment planning. Magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}) is a key diagnostic tool, and deep learning models have shown promise in automating tumor classification. However, challenges remain in achieving high accuracy while maintaining interpretability for clinical use.
Methods:
This study explores the use of transfer learning with pre-trained architectures, including {VGG}16, {DenseNet}121, and Inception-{ResNet}-v2, to classify brain tumors from {MRI} images. An ensemble-based classifier was developed using a majority voting strategy to improve robustness. To enhance clinical applicability, explainability techniques such as Grad-{CAM}++ and Integrated Gradients were employed, allowing visualization of model decision-making.
Results:
The ensemble model outperformed individual Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) architectures, achieving an accuracy of 86.17\% in distinguishing gliomas, meningiomas, pituitary adenomas, and benign cases. Interpretability techniques provided heatmaps that identified key regions influencing model predictions, aligning with radiological features and enhancing trust in the results.
Conclusions:
The proposed ensemble-based deep learning framework improves the accuracy and interpretability of brain tumor classification from {MRI} images. By combining multiple {CNN} architectures and integrating explainability methods, this approach offers a more reliable and transparent diagnostic tool to support medical professionals in clinical decision-making.},

	abstract = {Recently, unmanned aerial vehicles ({UAVs}) have been used in several applications of environmental modeling and land use inventories. At the same time, the computer vision-based remote sensing image classification models are needed to monitor the modifications over time such as vegetation, inland water, bare soil or human infrastructure regardless of spectral, spatial, temporal, and radiometric resolutions. In this aspect, this paper proposes an ensemble of {DL}-based multimodal land cover classification ({EDL}-{MMLCC}) models using remote sensing images. The {EDL}-{MMLCC} technique aims to classify remote sensing images into the different cloud, shades, and land cover classes. Primarily, median filtering-based preprocessing and data augmentation techniques take place. In addition, an ensemble of {DL} models, namely {VGG}-19, Capsule Network ({CapsNet}), and {MobileNet}, is used for feature extraction. In addition, the training process of the {DL} models can be enhanced by the use of hosted cuckoo optimization ({HCO}) algorithm. Finally, the salp swarm algorithm ({SSA}) with regularized extreme learning machine ({RELM}) classifier is applied for land cover classification. The design of the {HCO} algorithm for hyperparameter optimization and {SSA} for parameter tuning of the {RELM} model helps to increase the classification outcome to a maximum level considerably. The proposed {EDL}-{MMLCC} technique is tested using an Amazon dataset from the Kaggle repository. The experimental results pointed out the promising performance of the {EDL}-{MMLCC} technique over the recent state of art approaches.},

Breast cancer, a particular kind of tumor that arises in breast cells, is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in women and is. Early breast cancer detection and classification are crucial. Early detection considerably increases the likelihood of survival, which motivates us to contribute to different detection techniques from a technical standpoint. Additionally, manual detection requires a lot of time and effort and carries the risk of pathologist error and inaccurate classification. To address these problems, in this study, a hybrid deep learning model that enables decision making based on data from multiple data sources is proposed and used with two different classifiers. By incorporating multi-omics data (clinical data, gene expression data, and copy number alteration data) from the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium ({METABRIC}) dataset, the accuracy of patient survival predictions is expected to be improved relative to prediction utilizing only one modality of data. A convolutional neural network ({CNN}) architecture is used for feature extraction. {LSTM} and {GRU} are used as classifiers. The accuracy achieved by {LSTM} is 97.0\%, and that achieved by {GRU} is 97.5, while using decision fusion ({LSTM} and {GRU}) achieves the best accuracy of 98.0\%.

	abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease ({AD}) is a condition with a complex pathogenesis, sometimes hereditary, characterized by the loss of neurons and synapses, along with the presence of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Early detection, particularly among individuals at high risk, is critical for effective treatment or prevention, yet remains challenging due to data variability and incompleteness. Most current research relies on single data modalities, potentially limiting comprehensive staging of {AD}. This study addresses this gap by integrating multimodal data—including clinical and genetic information—using deep learning ({DL}) models, with a specific focus on random vector functional link ({RVFL}) networks, to enhance early detection of {AD} and mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}). Our findings demonstrate that ensemble deep {RVFL} ({edRVFL}) models, when combined with effective data imputation techniques such as Winsorized-mean (Wmean), achieve superior performance in detecting early stages of {AD}. Notably, the {edRVFL} model achieved an accuracy of 98.8\%, precision of 98.3\%, recall of 98.4\%, and F1-score of 98.2\%, outperforming traditional machine learning models like support vector machines, random forests, and decision trees. This underscores the importance of integrating advanced imputation strategies and deep learning techniques in {AD} diagnosis.},

Most of the comments of the users in these networks have emotional aspects, which make the multimodal sentiment analysis ({MSA}) an important and attractive research topics in this area. In this paper, an ensemble transfer learning method is exploited to propose a hybrid {MSA} model based on weighted convolutional neural networks. The extended Dempster–Shafer (Yager) theory is also utilized in the proposed method of this paper to fuse the outputs of text and image classifiers to determine the final polarity at the decision level. The pre-trained {VGG}16 network is firstly used to extract visual features and fine-tune on the {MVSA}-Multiple and T4SA datasets for image sentiment classification. The Mask-{RCNN} model is then exploited to determine the objects in the images and convert them to text. The {BERT} model receives the output of this step along with the textual descriptions of the images for extracting the text features and embedding the words. The output of the {BERT} model is then imported into a weighted convolutional neural network ensemble ({WCNNE}). The texts are classified by several weak learners using the {AdaBoost} that is an ensemble learning technique in which, classifiers are trained sequentially. The combined use of several weak classifiers results in a strong classification. The {WCNNE} improves the performance and increases the accuracy of the results. As a fusing phase at the decision level, the outputs of the {VGG}16 and the {WCNNE} models will be finally merged using the extended Dempster-Shafer theory to obtain the correct sentiment label. The results of the experiments on the {MVSA}-Multiple and T4SA datasets show that the proposed model is better than the other compared methods and achieved an appropriate accuracy of 0.9348 on {MVSA} and 0.9689 on the T4SA datasets. Moreover, the proposed model reduces training time due to the use of transfer learning and the proposed {AdaBoostCNN} achieves better results compared to the single {CNN}.},

	abstract = {In recent years, deep neural networks have evolved rapidly in engineering technology, with models becoming larger and deeper. However, for most companies, developing large models is extremely costly and highly risky. Researchers usually focus on the performance of the model, neglecting its cost and accessibility. In fact, most regular business scenarios do not require high-level {AI}. A simple and inexpensive modeling method for fulfilling certain demands for practical applications of {AI} is needed. In this paper, a Fragmented neural network method is proposed. Inspired by the random forest algorithm, both the samples and features are randomly sampled on image data. Images are randomly split into smaller pieces. Weak neural networks are trained using these fragmented images, and many weak neural networks are then ensembled to build a strong neural network by voting. In this way, sufficient accuracy is achieved while reducing the complexity and data volume of each base learner, enabling mass production through parallel and distributed computing. By conducting experiments on the {MNIST} and {CIFAR}10 datasets, we build a model pool using {FNN}, {CNN}, {DenseNet}, and {ResNet} as the basic network structure. We find that the accuracy of the ensemble weak network is significantly higher than that of each base learner. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the ensemble network is highly dependent on the performance of each base learner. The accuracy of the ensemble network is comparable to or even exceeds that of the full model and has better robustness. Unlike other similar studies, we do not pursue {SOTA} models. Instead, we achieved results close to the full model with a smaller number of parameters and amount of data.},

	abstract = {Glioma is the most common malignant tumor of the central nervous system, and diffuse Glioma is classified as grades {II}-{IV} by world health organization ({WHO}). In the the cancer genome atlas ({TCGA}) Glioma dataset, grade {II} and {III} Gliomas are classified as low-grade glioma ({LGG}), and grade {IV} Gliomas as glioblastoma multiforme ({GBM}). In clinical practice, the survival and treatment process with Glioma patients depends on properly diagnosing the subtype. With this background, there has been much research on Glioma over the years. Among these researches, the origin and evolution of whole slide images ({WSIs}) have led to many attempts to support diagnosis by image analysis. On the other hand, due to the disease complexities of Glioma patients, multimodal analysis using various types of data rather than a single data set has been attracting attention. In our proposed method, multiple deep learning models are used to extract features from histopathology images, and the features of the obtained images are concatenated with those of the clinical data in a fusion approach. Then, we perform patch-level classification by machine learning ({ML}) using the concatenated features. Based on the performances of the deep learning models, we ensemble feature sets from top three models and perform further classifications. In the experiments with our proposed ensemble fusion {AI} ({EFAI}) approach using {WSIs} and clinical data of diffuse Glioma patients on {TCGA} dataset, the classification accuracy of the proposed multimodal ensemble fusion method is 0.936 with an area under the curve ({AUC}) value of 0.967 when tested on a balanced dataset of 240 {GBM}, 240 {LGG} patients. On an imbalanced dataset of 141 {GBM}, 242 {LGG} patients the proposed method obtained the accuracy of 0.936 and {AUC} of 0.967. Our proposed ensemble fusion approach significantly outperforms the classification using only histopathology images alone with deep learning models. Therefore, our approach can be used to support the diagnosis of Glioma patients and can lead to better diagnosis.},

	abstract = {In light of the ongoing battle against {COVID}-19, while the pandemic may eventually subside, sporadic cases may still emerge, underscoring the need for accurate detection from radiological images. However, the limited explainability of current deep learning models restricts clinician acceptance. To address this issue, our research integrates multiple {CNN} models with explainable {AI} techniques, ensuring model interpretability before ensemble construction. Our approach enhances both accuracy and interpretability by evaluating advanced {CNN} models on the largest publicly available X-ray dataset, {COVIDx} {CXR}-3, which includes 29,986 images, and the {CT} scan dataset for {SARS}-{CoV}-2 from Kaggle, which includes a total of 2,482 images. We also employed additional public datasets for cross-dataset evaluation, ensuring a thorough assessment of model performance across various imaging conditions. By leveraging methods including {LIME}, {SHAP}, Grad-{CAM}, and Grad-{CAM}++, we provide transparent insights into model decisions. Our ensemble model, which includes {DenseNet}169, {ResNet}50, and {VGG}16, demonstrates strong performance. For the X-ray image dataset, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1-score, and {AUC} are recorded at 99.00\%, 99.00\%, 99.00\%, 0.99, and 0.99, respectively. For the {CT} image dataset, these metrics are 96.18\%, 96.18\%, 96.18\%, 0.9618, and 0.96, respectively. Our methodology bridges the gap between precision and interpretability in clinical settings by combining model diversity with explainability, promising enhanced disease diagnosis and greater clinician acceptance.},

While artificial intelligence ({AI}) models have shown promising results in analyzing individual data modalities, there is increasing recognition that models integrating multiple complementary data sources, so-called multimodal {AI}, could enhance clinical decision-making. This scoping review examines the landscape of deep learning-based multimodal {AI} applications across the medical domain, analyzing 432 papers published between 2018 and 2024. We provide an extensive overview of multimodal {AI} development across different medical disciplines, examining various architectural approaches, fusion strategies, and common application areas. Our analysis reveals that multimodal {AI} models consistently outperform their unimodal counterparts, with an average improvement of 6.2 percentage points in {AUC}. However, several challenges persist, including cross-departmental coordination, heterogeneous data characteristics, and incomplete datasets. We critically assess the technical and practical challenges in developing multimodal {AI} systems and discuss potential strategies for their clinical implementation, including a brief overview of commercially available multimodal {AI} models for clinical decision-making. Additionally, we identify key factors driving multimodal {AI} development and propose recommendations to accelerate the field’s maturation.

The aim is to classify three nail diseases: melanoma, beau's nails, and eczema, in addition to healthy nails. Further, the proposed approach is compared to the transfer learning approach, where a pre-trained model is used for feature extraction and classification. The experiment results indicate that the {DHL} approach is superior to the transfer learning approach.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Fingernail metabolomics provides a novel, non-invasive platform that captures long-term biochemical fluctuations for identifying reliable biomarkers for dementia and mild cognitive impairment ({MCI}) due to Alzheimer's disease ({AD}).
{METHODS}: This study enrolled 199 participants stratified by Clinical Dementia Rating ({CDR}) scores. Fingernail clippings were collected and subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometry based metabolomic analysis. Differentially expressed metabolites ({DEMs}) were identified across cognitive groups using clustering, ordinal logistic regression, and machine learning approaches. Pathway enrichment and correlation analyses were performed to explore underlying disease mechanisms and clinical relevance.
{RESULTS}: Thirty {DEMs} were discovered across the five {CDR} categories. Notably, Dodecanoic Acid demonstrated a pronounced decline from cognitively normal individuals ({CDR} = 0) to advanced {AD} ({CDR} = 3). After adjustment for age, sex, education, body mass index, lifestyle factors, nutrition, and sleep quality, Dodecanoic Acid remained independently associated with disease severity ({OR} = 0.845, p = 0.019). Importantly, within each {CDR} category, Dodecanoic Acid levels showed no significant differences between individuals with and without 18F-{AV}45 {PET}-confirmed amyloid pathology (all p {\textgreater} 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated that lower levels of Dodecanoic Acid were linked to greater cognitive impairment ({AVLT}-{IR}: r = 0.29; {ADAS}-Cog: r = -0.32). Pathway enrichment highlighted significant disruptions in fatty acid metabolism, suggesting an energy regulation deficit in {AD}. A machine learning model using 29 {DEMs} achieved an overall accuracy of 67.2 \% for classifying participants into {NC}, {MCI}, or dementia due to {AD} groups. The model's micro-averaged {AUC} was 0.803, with one-vs-rest {AUCs} of 0.71 to 0.87, demonstrating good discriminatory power. Notably, dodecanoic acid was the top contributor in the model, underscoring its potential as a diagnostic biomarker.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Dodecanoic Acid emerges as a critical biomarker reflecting disrupted fatty acid metabolism in {AD} progression. By leveraging fingernail metabolomics for long-term metabolic profiling, this non-invasive strategy offers a scalable approach for early diagnosis, staging, and monitoring of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Disease severity measures are essential in guiding treatment and evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. However, due to subsidy, convenience and low costs of health care in Taiwan, doctor usually needs to manage nearly hundreds of patients in single outpatient clinic, leading to difficulty in performing complex assessment tools. For instance, Nail Psoriasis Severity index ({NAPSI}) is used by dermatologists to measure the severity of nail psoriasis in clinical trials, but its calculation is quite time-consuming, which hampers its application in daily clinical practice. Therefore, we developed a simple, fast and automatic system for the assessment of nail psoriasis severity by constructing a standard photography capturing system combined with utilizing one of the deep learning architectures, mask R-{CNN}. This system not only assist doctors in capturing signs of disease and normal skin, but also able to extract features without pre-processing of image data. Expectantly, the system could help dermatologists make accurate diagnosis, assessment as well as provide precise treatment decision more efficiently.},

This study proposes a lightweight and efficient {RetinaNet} variant tailored for medical edge device deployment. The model reduces computational overhead while maintaining high detection accuracy by replacing the computationally intensive {ResNet} backbone with {MobileNet} and leveraging depthwise separable convolutions. The modified {RetinaNet} achieves an average precision ({AP}) of 32.1, surpassing state-of-the-art models in small tumor detection ({APS}: 14.3) and large tumor localization ({APL}: 49.7). Furthermore, the model significantly reduces computational costs, making real-time analysis feasible on low-power hardware. Clinical relevance is a key focus of this work. The proposed model addresses the diagnostic challenges of small, variable-sized tumors often overlooked by existing methods. Its lightweight architecture enables accurate and timely tumor localization on portable devices, bridging the gap in diagnostic accessibility for underserved regions. Extensive experiments on the {BRATS} dataset demonstrate the model robustness across tumor sizes and configurations, with confidence scores consistently exceeding 81\%.

	abstract = {Background Machine learning ({ML}) algorithms have generally enhanced the speed and accuracy of image-based diagnosis, and treatment strategy planning, compared to the traditional approach of interpreting medical images by experienced radiologists. Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) have been particularly useful in this regard. However, training {CNNs} come with significant time and computational cost necessitating the development of efficient solutions for deploying {CNNs} in low-resource environments. This study investigates the use of pre-trained {CNNs} as feature extractors in medical imaging analyses and highlights the key considerations to be taken into account when implementing these extractors. Methods Eight medical imaging datasets covering several diseases (e.g. breast cancer, brain tumor and malaria) were used. Five {ML} algorithms (k-nearest neighbours, logistic regression, naïve Bayes, random forests and light gradient boosting machine) were implemented with three pre-trained {CNN} models ({VGG}-16, {EfficientNet}-B0, and {ResNet}-50). These pre-trained models were deployed as feature extractors fed into the classifiers for image classification tasks. The performance of these classifiers was assessed using a ten-fold cross validation scheme with metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, specificity, sensitivity, {AUC}-{ROC}, Matthews’ correlation coefficient ({MCC}), precision, time and space complexities. Results From our experiments, we found a general improvement in {ML} models’ performance after feature extraction ({FE}). Of the three {FE} models tested,{EfficientNet}-B0 performed best in terms of predicitve performance i.e. accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, {AUC}-{ROC}, {MCC}, F1 score, and precision. However, {VGG}-16 had the best performance in terms of time and memory efficiency. Our results identify two conditions necessary for the optimal performance of the {FE} models; (i) balanced datasets - a set where classes or categories are represented in approximately equal proportions, (ii) big data sets - adequate number of objects for training and testing. Interestingly, the performance of the {ML} models did not correlate with the number of class labels i.e. the type of classification task whether binary or multi-class had no influence in the models’ performance. Of the five algorithms investigated, logistic regression benefitted the most from the adoption of the feature extractors. Conclusion Our results confirm that the use of {CNNs} as feature extractors offer an effective balance between high performance and computational efficiency, making them well-suited for use in low-resource environments.},

This survey investigates the landscape of lightweight deep learning models tailored for edge computing environments. The survey explores various model compression techniques used to design and optimize deep learning models for edge deployment, including model quantization, pruning, and knowledge distillation. Emphasis is placed on strategies to reduce model size, computational complexity, and memory footprint while maintaining satisfactory performance levels. Additionally, the study examines the performances of these techniques on three real-life datasets evaluating lightweight deep learning models, highlighting the importance of balanced datasets representative of edge device deployment scenarios. Furthermore, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of lightweight deep learning models for edge devices, offering insights into design considerations, optimization techniques, and performance evaluation methodologies. The ffndings show that most of the compression techniques suffer from performance degradation, proving the existence of a trade-off between compression and performance. Therefore, we proposed a hybrid losslesscompressed model by combining pruning quantization, and knowledge distillation, to reduce parameters and weights, resulting in a lightweight model. The proposed model is three times smaller than the vanilla {CNN} model and achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 97\% after compression, which shows the effectiveness of our approach. These results will serve as a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners aiming to develop efffcient and scalable deep learning solutions for edge computing applications.},

	abstract = {The interpretation of medical images with computer-aided diagnosis ({CAD}) system is arduous due to the complex structure of cancerous lesions within different imaging modalities, high degree of resemblance between the inter-classes, presence of dissimilar characteristics in intra-classes, the scarcity of medical data and the presence of artifacts and noises. In this study, these challenges are addressed by developing a shallow Convolutional Neural Network ({CNN}) model with optimal configuration performing ablation study by altering layer structure and hyper-parameters and utilizing suitable augmentation technique. Eight medical datasets with different modalities are investigated where the proposed model, named {MNet}-10, with low computational complexity is able to yield optimal performance across all the datasets. The impact of photometric and geometric augmentation techniques on different datasets is also evaluated. We selected the mammogram dataset to proceed with the ablation study for being one of the most challenging imaging modalities. Before generating the model, the dataset is augmented using the two approaches. A base {CNN} model is constructed first and applied to both the augmented and non-augmented mammogram datasets where the highest accuracy is obtained with photometric dataset. Therefore, the architecture and hyper-parameters of the model are determined by performing ablation study on the base model using the mammogram photometric dataset. Afterwards, the robustness of the network and impact of different augmentation techniques are assessed by training the model with the rest of the seven datasets. We obtain test accuracy of 97.34\% on the mammogram, 98.43\% on the skin cancer, 99.54\% on the brain tumor magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI}), 97.29\% on the {COVID} chest X-ray, 96.31\% on the tympanic membrane, 99.82\% on the chest computed tomography ({CT}) scan, 98.75\% on the breast cancer ultrasound datasets with photometric augmentation and 96.76\% on the breast cancer microscopic biopsy dataset with geometric augmentation. Moreover, some elastic deformation augmentation methods are explored with the proposed model using all the datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Finally, {VGG}16, {InceptionV}3 and {ResNet}50 were trained on the best-performing augmented datasets and compared the performance consistency with {MNet}-10 model. The findings may aid future researchers in medical data analysis involving ablation studies and augmentation techniques.},

	abstract = {Skin cancer is one of the most common and life-threatening diseases. In the current era, early detection remains a significant challenge, particularly in remote and underserved regions with limited internet access. Traditional skin cancer detection systems often depend on image classification using deep learning models that require constant connectivity to internet access, creating barriers in areas with poor infrastructure. To address this limitation, {CNN} provides an innovative solution by enabling on-device machine learning on low-computing Internet of Things ({IoT}) devices. This study evaluates the performance of a convolutional neural network ({CNN}) model trained on 10,000 dermoscopic images spanning seven classes from the Harvard Skin Lesion dataset. Unlike previous research, which seldom offers detailed performance evaluations on {IoT} hardware, this work benchmarks the {CNN} model on multiple single-board computers ({SBCs}), including low-computing devices like Raspberry Pi and Jetson Nano. The evaluation focuses on classification accuracy and hardware efficiency, analyzing the impact of varying training dataset sizes to assess the model’s scalability and effectiveness on resource-constrained devices. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying accurate and efficient skin cancer detection systems directly on low-power hardware. The simulation results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 98.25\%, with the fastest hardware being the Raspberry Pi 5, which achieves a detection time of 0.01 s.},

To fill this gap in knowledge, we compared the diagnostic accuracy of physicians with computer algorithms called symptom checkers.Symptom checkers are websites and apps that help patients with self-diagnosis. After answering a series of questions, the user is given a list of rank-ordered potential diagnoses generated by a computer algorithm. Previously, we evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of 23 symptom checkers using 45 clinical vignettes. The vignettes included the patient’s medical history and had no physical examination or test findings.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Diagnostic and prognostic models are typically evaluated with measures of accuracy that do not address clinical consequences. Decision-analytic techniques allow assessment of clinical outcomes but often require collection of additional information and may be cumbersome to apply to models that yield a continuous result. The authors sought a method for evaluating and comparing prediction models that incorporates clinical consequences,requires only the data set on which the models are tested,and can be applied to models that have either continuous or dichotomous results.
{METHOD}: The authors describe decision curve analysis, a simple, novel method of evaluating predictive models. They start by assuming that the threshold probability of a disease or event at which a patient would opt for treatment is informative of how the patient weighs the relative harms of a false-positive and a false-negative prediction. This theoretical relationship is then used to derive the net benefit of the model across different threshold probabilities. Plotting net benefit against threshold probability yields the "decision curve." The authors apply the method to models for the prediction of seminal vesicle invasion in prostate cancer patients. Decision curve analysis identified the range of threshold probabilities in which a model was of value, the magnitude of benefit, and which of several models was optimal.
{CONCLUSION}: Decision curve analysis is a suitable method for evaluating alternative diagnostic and prognostic strategies that has advantages over other commonly used measures and techniques.},

	abstract = {This article delves into the interface between the art of medical diagnosis and the mathematical foundations of probability, the Bayes theorem. In a healthcare ecosystem witnessing an artificial intelligence ({AI})-driven transformation, understanding the convergence becomes crucial for physicians. Contrary to viewing {AI} as a mysterious “black box,” we demonstrate how every diagnostic decision by a medical practitioner is, in essence, Bayesian reasoning in action. The Bayes theorem is a mathematical translation of systematically updating our belief: it quantifies how an additional piece of information updates our prior belief in something. Using a clinical scenario of Kartagener syndrome, we showcase the parallels between a physician’s evolving diagnostic thought process and the mathematical updating of prior beliefs with new evidence. By reimagining medical diagnosis through the lens of Bayes, this paper aims to demystify {AI}, accentuating its potential role as an enhancer of clinical acumen rather than a replacement. The ultimate vision presented is one of harmony, where {AI} serves as a symbiotic partner to physicians, with the shared goal of holistic patient care.},

	abstract = {Melanonychia is a brownish-black staining of the nail plate. It can affect a single or several nails on both the fingers and toes. Melanocytic activation and melanocytic hyperplasia are the two basic mechanisms involved in the development of melanonychia. Melanocytic activation occurs as enhanced melanic pigmentation of the nail matrix epithelium and nail plate without a corresponding rise in the number of melanocytes, resulting in melanonychia. The number of matrix melanocytes increases in melanocytic hyperplasia. Involvement of a pathogen has also been suggested as a mechanism for its development. A thorough clinical history should be taken, including questions regarding various triggers and causal events, as well as the use of a questionnaire. A proper detailed physical examination is of a great need to properly identify the type of melanonychia and to rule out melanoma which is of great importance in clinical practice. Onychoscopy and nail biopsy also acts as an aid in proper diagnosis of melanonychia. Treatment of melanonychia basically depends on the underlying etiology. One major aim is to rule out melanoma if present and its proper management in time.},

Nail matrix melanoma is relatively rare, occurs almost always in adults in-volves more frequently the first toe or thumb.The most common nail unit cancer,squamous cell carcinoma / Bowen disease ({SCC}) of the nail matrix is seldom pigmented.

Dermatoscopy of the nail plate and its free edge significantly improves the clinical diagnosis, since specific patterns have been associated to each one of the causes of melanonychia. Based on knowledge generated and pub-lished in the last decades, we propose herein a stepwise diagnostic approach for melanonychia striata longitudinalis: 1) Hemorrhage first 2) Age matters 3) Number of nails matters 4) Free edge matters 5) Brown or gray? 6) Size matters 7) Regular or irregular and, finally,“follow back”.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Nail changes in people living with human immunodeficiency virus ({HIV}) have been scarcely reported. The aim of this study was to establish the frequency and characteristics of nail alterations observed in adults with {HIV} infection in a third-level hospital in Mexico.

Method
Observational and cross-sectional study carried out in 205 patients receiving care at the {HIV}/{AIDS} Clinic of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Médicas y Nutrición Salvador Zubirán ({INCMNSZ}) in Mexico City. We performed a nail and iconographic assessment of both hands and toenails. We collected information of demographic and clinical variables, as well as drugs use, and antiretroviral treatment used by the participants through a questionnaire and from medical records. We performed direct cytological examinations and nail mycological cultures in participants with symptoms of onychomycosis.

Results
The participants were predominantly male patients (91.2\%), with a mean age of 41 (range 21–78) years, under antiretroviral therapy (91.2\%), with a suppressed viral load (78.5\%) and mean {CD}4+ lymphocyte count of 379.5 (range 20–1,162) cells/μL. Fitzpatrick's {IV} phototype was prevailing in the studied population (70\%). Nail changes were documented in 72.2\% of the patients; being pigmentary changes (37.1\%) and trauma (30.7\%) the most frequent. Onychomycosis was observed in 26.3\%; with total dystrophic onychomycosis as the most frequent clinical variant (68.5\%). We obtained fungal isolates in 59.3\% of participants and Candida parapsilosis was the most frequent of these (37.5\%).

Conclusions
We observed a high prevalence of nail changes with very diverse etiology, as well as a variety of nondermatophytic yeasts and molds isolates associated with cases with onychomycosis. These findings reinforce and confirm the need for routine nail examination and stress the importance of medical personnel working with people living with {HIV} to have broad knowledge of nail pathology.},

Chronic pathological changes associated with a wide range of systemic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and rheumatological conditions like systemic sclerosis, can manifest as observable microvascular changes in the terminal capillaries of nailfolds. The current gold standard relies on experts performing manual evaluations, which is an exhaustive time-intensive, and subjective process. In this study, we demonstrate the viability of a deep learning approach as an automated clinical screening tool. Our dataset consists of {NFC} images from a total of 225 participants, with normal images accounting for 6\% of the dataset. This study introduces a robust framework utilizing cascade transfer learning based on {EfficientNet}-B0 to differentiate between normal and abnormal cases within {NFC} images. The results demonstrate that pre-trained {EfficientNet}-B0 on the {ImageNet} dataset, followed by transfer learning from domain-specific classes, significantly enhances the classifier’s performance in distinguishing between Normal and Abnormal classes. Our proposed model achieved superior performance, with accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and {ROC}\_AUC of 1.00, significantly outperforming both models of single transfer learning on the pre-trained {EfficientNet}-B0 and cascade transfer learning on a convolutional neural network, which each attained an accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of 0.67 and a {ROC}\_AUC of 0.83.

	abstract = {Objectives
The first objective of this study was to implement and assess the performance and reliability of a vision transformer ({ViT})-based deep-learning model, an ‘off-the-shelf’ artificial intelligence solution, for identifying distinct signs of microangiopathy in nailfold capilloroscopy ({NFC}) images of patients with {SSc}. The second objective was to compare the {ViT}’s analysis performance with that of practising rheumatologists.

Methods
{NFC} images of patients prospectively enrolled in our European Scleroderma Trials and Research group ({EUSTAR}) and Very Early Diagnosis of Systemic Sclerosis ({VEDOSS}) local registries were used. The primary outcome investigated was the {ViT}’s classification performance for identifying disease-associated changes (enlarged capillaries, giant capillaries, capillary loss, microhaemorrhages) and the presence of the scleroderma pattern in these images using a cross-fold validation setting. The secondary outcome involved a comparison of the {ViT}’s performance vs that of rheumatologists on a reliability set, consisting of a subset of 464 {NFC} images with majority vote–derived ground-truth labels.

Results
We analysed 17 126 {NFC} images derived from 234 {EUSTAR} and 55 {VEDOSS} patients. The {ViT} had good performance in identifying the various microangiopathic changes in capillaries by {NFC} [area under the curve ({AUC}) from 81.8\% to 84.5\%]. In the reliability set, the rheumatologists reached a higher average accuracy, as well as a better trade-off between sensitivity and specificity compared with the {ViT}. However, the annotators’ performance was variable, and one out of four rheumatologists showed equal or lower classification measures compared with the {ViT}.

Conclusions
The {ViT} is a modern, well-performing and readily available tool for assessing patterns of microangiopathy on {NFC} images, and it may assist rheumatologists in generating consistent and high-quality {NFC} reports; however, the final diagnosis of a scleroderma pattern in any individual case needs the judgement of an experienced observer.},

	abstract = {Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. We present a residual learning framework to ease the training of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. We explicitly reformulate the layers as learning residual functions with reference to the layer inputs, instead of learning unreferenced functions. We provide comprehensive empirical evidence showing that these residual networks are easier to optimize, and can gain accuracy from considerably increased depth. On the {ImageNet} dataset we evaluate residual nets with a depth of up to 152 layers---8x deeper than {VGG} nets but still having lower complexity. An ensemble of these residual nets achieves 3.57\% error on the {ImageNet} test set. This result won the 1st place on the {ILSVRC} 2015 classification task. We also present analysis on {CIFAR}-10 with 100 and 1000 layers. The depth of representations is of central importance for many visual recognition tasks. Solely due to our extremely deep representations, we obtain a 28\% relative improvement on the {COCO} object detection dataset. Deep residual nets are foundations of our submissions to {ILSVRC} \& {COCO} 2015 competitions, where we also won the 1st places on the tasks of {ImageNet} detection, {ImageNet} localization, {COCO} detection, and {COCO} segmentation.},

	abstract = {In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our goal is to help advance the understanding of network design and discover design principles that generalize across settings. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design network design spaces that parametrize populations of networks. The overall process is analogous to classic manual design of networks, but elevated to the design space level. Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call {RegNet}. The core insight of the {RegNet} parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the {RegNet} design space and arrive at interesting findings that do not match the current practice of network design. The {RegNet} design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of flop regimes. Under comparable training settings and flops, the {RegNet} models outperform the popular {EfficientNet} models while being up to 5x faster on {GPUs}.},

To develop this family of models, we use a combination of training-aware neural architecture search and scaling, to jointly optimize training speed and parameter efficiency. The models were searched from the search space enriched with new ops such as Fused-{MBConv}. Our experiments show that {EfficientNetV}2 models train much faster than state-of-the-art models while being up to 6.8x smaller. Our training can be further sped up by progressively increasing the image size during training, but it often causes a drop in accuracy. To compensate for this accuracy drop, we propose to adaptively adjust regularization (e.g., dropout and data augmentation) as well, such that we can achieve both fast training and good accuracy. With progressive learning, our {EfficientNetV}2 significantly outperforms previous models on {ImageNet} and {CIFAR}/Cars/Flowers datasets. By pretraining on the same {ImageNet}21k, our {EfficientNetV}2 achieves 87.3\% top-1 accuracy on {ImageNet} {ILSVRC}2012, outperforming the recent {ViT} by 2.0\% accuracy while training 5x-11x faster using the same computing resources.

	abstract = {Large-scale {NLP} models have been shown to significantly improve the performance on language tasks with no signs of saturation. They also demonstrate amazing few-shot capabilities like that of human beings. This paper aims to explore large-scale models in computer vision. We tackle three major issues in training and application of large vision models, including training instability, resolution gaps between pre-training and fine-tuning, and hunger on labelled data. Three main techniques are proposed: 1) a residual-post-norm method combined with cosine attention to improve training stability; 2) A log-spaced continuous position bias method to effectively transfer models pre-trained using low-resolution images to downstream tasks with high-resolution inputs; 3) A self-supervised pre-training method, {SimMIM}, to reduce the needs of vast labeled images. Through these techniques, this paper successfully trained a 3 billion-parameter Swin Transformer V2 model, which is the largest dense vision model to date, and makes it capable of training with images of up to 1,536\${\textbackslash}times\$1,536 resolution. It set new performance records on 4 representative vision tasks, including {ImageNet}-V2 image classification, {COCO} object detection, {ADE}20K semantic segmentation, and Kinetics-400 video action classification. Also note our training is much more efficient than that in Google's billion-level visual models, which consumes 40 times less labelled data and 40 times less training time.

We provide empirical evidence that our proposed modification (i) decouples the optimal choice of weight decay factor from the setting of the learning rate for both standard {SGD} and Adam and (ii) substantially improves Adam's generalization performance, allowing it to compete with {SGD} with momentum on image classification datasets (on which it was previously typically outperformed by the latter).

	abstract = {In this study, we systematically investigate the impact of class imbalance on classification performance of convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and compare frequently used methods to address the issue. Class imbalance is a common problem that has been comprehensively studied in classical machine learning, yet very limited systematic research is available in the context of deep learning. In our study, we use three benchmark datasets of increasing complexity, {MNIST}, {CIFAR}-10 and {ImageNet}, to investigate the effects of imbalance on classification and perform an extensive comparison of several methods to address the issue: oversampling, undersampling, two-phase training, and thresholding that compensates for prior class probabilities. Our main evaluation metric is area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ({ROC} {AUC}) adjusted to multi-class tasks since overall accuracy metric is associated with notable difficulties in the context of imbalanced data. Based on results from our experiments we conclude that (i) the effect of class imbalance on classification performance is detrimental; (ii) the method of addressing class imbalance that emerged as dominant in almost all analyzed scenarios was oversampling; (iii) oversampling should be applied to the level that completely eliminates the imbalance, whereas the optimal undersampling ratio depends on the extent of imbalance; (iv) as opposed to some classical machine learning models, oversampling does not cause overfitting of {CNNs}; (v) thresholding should be applied to compensate for prior class probabilities when overall number of properly classified cases is of interest.},

However, what levels of features to be reused are problem-dependent, and uniformly finetuning all layers of pretrained models may be suboptimal. This insight has partly motivated the recent differential {TL} strategies, such as {TransFusion} ({TF}) and layer-wise finetuning ({LWFT}), which treat the layers in the pretrained models differentially. In this paper, we add one more strategy into this family, called {TruncatedTL}, which reuses and finetunes appropriate bottom layers and directly discards the remaining layers. This yields not only superior {MIC} performance but also compact models for efficient inference, compared to other differential {TL} methods.

	abstract = {In the context of medical imaging and machine learning, one of the most pressing challenges is the effective adaptation of pre-trained models to specialized medical contexts. Despite the availability of advanced pre-trained models, their direct application to the highly specialized and diverse field of medical imaging often falls short due to the unique characteristics of medical data. This study provides a comprehensive analysis on the performance of various fine-tuning methods applied to pre-trained models across a spectrum of medical imaging domains, including X-ray, {MRI}, Histology, Dermoscopy, and Endoscopic surgery. We evaluated eight fine-tuning strategies, including standard techniques such as fine-tuning all layers or fine-tuning only the classifier layers, alongside methods such as gradually unfreezing layers, regularization based fine-tuning and adaptive learning rates. We selected three well-established {CNN} architectures ({ResNet}-50, {DenseNet}-121, and {VGG}-19) to cover a range of learning and feature extraction scenarios. Although our results indicate that the efficacy of these fine-tuning methods significantly varies depending on both the architecture and the medical imaging type, strategies such as combining Linear Probing with Full Fine-tuning resulted in notable improvements in over 50\% of the evaluated cases, demonstrating general effectiveness across medical domains. Moreover, Auto-{RGN}, which dynamically adjusts learning rates, led to performance enhancements of up to 11\% for specific modalities. Additionally, the {DenseNet} architecture showed more pronounced benefits from alternative fine-tuning approaches compared to traditional full fine-tuning. This work not only provides valuable insights for optimizing pre-trained models in medical image analysis but also suggests the potential for future research into more advanced architectures and fine-tuning methods.},
